	UNLOCK CONSOLE AND DATA SWITCHES
	PUSH THE SWITCHES IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:
	RESET
	EXAMINE THIS
	STOP PAR
	STOP NXM
	REPEAT
	EXAMINE NEXT

3.  IF THE LIGHTS ON THE ADDRESS SWITCHES STOP WITH 18 & 19 ON
	YOU WIN. I.E. 600000 IN ADDRESS SWITCHES.
	IF OK CONT TO STEP 4.-----IF NOT OK GO TO SHEET 2

4.  CLEAR THE FOLLOWING SWITCHES:
	STOP PAR
	STOP NXM

5.  PUSH THE RESET SWITCH SEVERAL TIMES.

	--------PREFERRED PROCEDURE--------
6A.  INSURE THAT "READ-IN DEVICE" SWITCHES 4 6 7 8  ARE ON---ONLY
	[LOCATED AT UPPER LEFT OF CONSOLE]
	PUSH THE READ IN SWITCH
	IF WORKING PROPERLY,YOU SHOULD GET"BOOTS"ON CONSOLE...GO TO STEP 7
	IF NOT BACK TO STEP 5.
	--------ALTERNATE PROCEDURE--------
6B.  PUT THE 128K.EXE TAPE INTO THE PAPER TAPE READER.
	INSURE THAT BOOTS TAPE IS POSITIONED PAST THE GARBAGE LEADER...
	...THE LAST LETTER OF WHICH IS AN  N  .
	PRESS THE FEED SWITCH  MOMENTARILY ON READER...TO ARM LOGIC.
--------INSURE THAT "READ-IN DEVICE" SWITCHES 5 & 9 ARE ON ----ONLY
	[LOCATED AT UPPER LEFT OF CONSOLE]

	  PUSH THE READ IN SWITCH
	[THE PTR SHOULD START READING TAPE]
	IF READ IN IS WORKING PROPERLY YOU SHOULD GET A (CR)
	IN APPROXMATLY 15 SECONDS. IF THERE IS NO (CR) THEN
	GO TO STEP 5...IF OK THEN CONTINUE WITH PROCEDURE...AT STEP 6B.
--------IF YOU FIND YOURSELF LOOPING BACK TO STEP 5...AND YOU FEEL YOU
	HAVE PROPERLY DONE THE ABOVE THEN GO TO SHEET 7 STEP 1.

7.  IF YOU WANT TO DUMP CORE TO DISK GO TO STEP 8.
	I.E. AFTER A MONITOR CRASH.
  IF NO DUMP WANTED GO TO STEP 10.

8.  INPUT ON THE CTY	DSKA:/D(CR)

9.  WAIT FOR APPROXIMATLY 30 SECONDS...YOU SHOULD GET A (CR)
   FROM BOOTS WHEN IT IS DONE DUMPING. THEN TO STEP 10

10.  INPUT A (CR) ON THE CTY.
   [A (CR) WITH NO ARGUMENTS WILL LOAD SYSTEM.SAV FROM DISK]
------------------------- SHEET 1 ------------------------- 2 OF 2

11.  AT THIS POINT INSURE THAT THE POWER FAIL LAMP IS NOT ON-OR THE
	SYSTEM WILL NOT RELOAD FOR YOU.  SEE SHEET 8.
12.ANSWER SYSCHK WITH	Y(CR)
   ANSWER WHY RELOAD WITH THE CLOSEST CAUSE FOR THE RELOAD. ANY ADDITIONAL
	 COMMENT YOU CAN OR CARE TO MAKE CAN BE INSERTED AT THIS TIME. 
	I.E.	WHY RELOAD	POWER SECOND ONE TODAY(CR)
				OTHER LOST DPA CONTROLLER(CR)
				OPR I FORGOT TO PUT DPB0 ON LINE(CR)
				SA STAND ALONE FOR DSK FORMATTING(CR)
	ONLY A SPACE BETWEEN THE 'SA' OR 'OPR' OR WHATEVER ...AND THE MESSAGE
	IS NECESSARY.IF YOU INPUT THE WRONG ANSWER YOU WILL GET AN AUTO-
	MATIC LIST OF POSSIBLE RESPONSES. ON A CRASH THAT WAS SOFTWARE CAUSED
	YOU WILL NOT BE ASKED 'WHY RELOAD' BECAUSE THE MONITOR WILL KNOW CAUSE.

13.ANSWER DATE	DD-MMM-YY(CR)

14.ANSWER TIME IN 24 HOUR CLOCK		1500(CR)	I.E.	3PM =1500

15.ANSWER STARTUP OPTION WITH GO(CR)
	USE ANY OTHER OPTION AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

16.AT THIS POINT IF THEIR IS ANY MEMORY OFF LINE OR A DISK PACK NOT
  AVAILABLE YOU WILL BE ASKED IF YOU WANT IT TO BE 1)ON LINE OR
  2) OFF LINE OR 3) DOWN. IF YOU WANT SAID UNIT TO BE UNAVAILABLE, ALWAYS
  ANSWER WITH		2(CR).
  IF YOU WANT THE DISK UNIT TO BE ON LINE...GO MAKE IT SO AND 
  ANSWER WITH		1(CR)

17.--------RELOCK THE CONSOLE AND DATA SWITCHES-----------
	THE SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY RUN THE SPOOLERS ETC AND BE UP
	IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES. IT WILL SEND A 'SYSTEM IS UP' MESSAGE TO ALL
	TTY'S. IF A MESSAGE THAT THE PDP 11 IS NOT RUNNING COMES UP ON
	CTY THEN GO TO STEP 18.
   ------- PLEASE MAKE A NOTE IN THE LOGBOOK AS TO WHAT HAPPENED!!!

18.TO RELOAD THE PDP11 DO THE FOLLOWING:
	AT PDP11 CONSOLE INSURE THAT ALL FOUR LGHTS ARE ON:
		RUN	BUS
		PROC	CONSOLE
	IF THEY ARE ON GO TO STEP 18A.
	IF THEY ARE NOT ON PUT HALT SWITCH DOWN
				PRESS START SWI SEVERAL TIMES
				PUT HALT SWITCH UP 
				GO TO 18A.
18A.    :W X(CR)
	X-R BOOT11(CR)
	X-/C(CR)
	X-SYS:DC76(CR)
AT THIS POINT SUBJOB X SHOULD SAY THE PDP11 IS LOADED...OR...
THE SYSTEM WILL CRASH WITH A 6MS STOPCODE.
IF IT CRASHES THEN: 
	UNLOCK CONSLOE AND DATA SWITCHES
	GO TO STEP 5.
------------------------ SHEET 2 -------------------------

	HERE BECAUSE REPEAT EXAMINE DIDN'T GET 192K ON LINE.

1.PRESS RESET SWITCH SEVERAL TIMES.
2.GO TO ALL THREE MEMORIES AND INSURE AWRQ LIGHT IS 'ON'.
	[LOCATED AT BOTTOM LEFT OF INDICATOR PANEL]
	IF NOT.....OPEN FRONT DOOR AND AT BOTTOM RIGHT ON SWITCH PANEL
		   THERE IS A RESET SWITCH-PRESS IT & SEE IF AWRQ COMES ON
		   IF OK GO TO STEP 3. IF NOT MEMORY IS DOWN [MAKE SURE THE
		   LAMP IN THAT POSITION WORKS...USE LAMP TEST INSIDE INDICATOR
		   COVER]
3.INSURE ALL PORTS ARE SELECTED...EACH PORT HAS A SWITCH LABELED:
	SEL DES....ALL SHOULD BE IN SEL POSITION.
4.TRY A REPEAT DEPOSIT THROUGH CORE:
	SET ALL DATA SWITCHES TO A ONE.
	CLEAR ALL ADDRESS SWITCHES [SINGLY OR USE CLR PB]
	PRESS RESET SWITCH
	PRESS DEPOSIT THIS.. [GOING TO ADDRESS 000000]
	STOP PAR AND STOP NXM SHOULD BE ON AT THIS TIME
	PRESS REPEAT SWITCH
	PRESS DEPOSIT NEXT
YOU SHOULD GET A MEMORY STOP WITH ADDRESS SWITCHES = 600000
IF NOT GO TO STEP 5.  IF OK CONT.

	PRESS RESET SWITCH
	CLEAR ADDRESS SWITCHES
	PRESS EXAMINE THIS
	PRESS REPEAT SWITCH
	PRESS EXAMINE NEXT
YOU SHOULD STOP WITH ADDRESS SWITCHWS = 600000
IF OK THEN DO DEPOSIT AND EXAMINE CYCLES USING [ABOVE AT STEP 4] ALL ZERO'S 
AND GO BACK FROM WHENCE YOU CAME...SHEET 1 STEP 4.

5.IF NOT OK CHECK FOR PARITY ERROR OR NXM. TO DO THIS YOU WILL HAVE TO 
	FIND THOSE INDICATORS IN BAY 3.

5A.	THE PARITY ERROR INDICATOR IS LOCATED AT THE TOP OF BAY 3.
	ROW 3 20TH INDICATOR FROM LEFT.
	IF IT IS ON GO TO SHEET 3.

5B.	THE NXM (NON EXISTENT MEMORY) INDICATOR IS ALSO IN BAY 3.
	ROW 5 10TH INDICATOR FROM LEFT.
	IF IT IS ON GO TO SHEET 4.
------------------------- SHEET 3 ------------------------ 1 OF 2
	PARITY ERROR ROUTINE

IN THIS ROUTINE WE ARE LOOKING FOR PARITY ERRORS IN CORE--SO THAT WE MAY
ISOLATE THE BAD MEMORY,DESELECT IT AND RELOAD THE SYSTEM. 

1.CLEAR ALL SWITCHES AND PRESS RESET SEVERAL TIMES.
  INSURE ADDRESS SWITCHES ARE EQUAL TO 000000.

2.SET STOP NXM SWITCH
  SET STOP PAR SWITCH..THESE SWITCHES SHOULD REMAIN ON FOR REST OF PROCEDURE.
2A.     PRESS EXAMINE THIS
	PRESS REPEAT
	PRESS EXAMINE NEXT
IF ADDRESS SWITCHES STOP AT OTHER THAN 600000 YOU HAVE A PARITY ERROR
GO TO STEP 3.

2B.IF THEY DID NOT STOP THEN:
	PRESS RESET
	CLEAR ADDRESS SWITCHES [=000000]
	SET DATA SWITCHES TO ALL ONE'S
	PRESS DEPOSIT THIS 
	PRESS REPEAT
	PRESS DEPOSIT NEXT
ADDRESS SWI SHOULD STOP EQUAL TO 6000000...IF THEY DO'T CALL DEC F.S.
	PRESS RESET
	CLEAR ADDRESS SWITCHES [=000000]
	PRESS EXAMINE THIS
	PRESS REPEAT
	PRESS EXAMINE NEXT
IF ADDRESS SWITCHES STOP AT OTHER THAN 600000 YOU HAVE A PARITY ERROR
GO TO STEP 3.

IF THEY DID NOT STOP THEN ONE MORE POSSIBILITY EXISTS:
	PRESS RESET
	CLEAR ADDRESS SWITCHES [=000000]
	SET DATA SWITCHES TO EQUAL 100000 000000
	PRESS DEPOSIT THIS
	PRESS REPEAT
	PRESS DEPOSIT NEXT
AGAIN ADDRESS SWI SHOULD STOP = 600000...IF NOT CALL DEC F.S.
	PRESS RESET
	CLEAR ADDRESS SWITCHES [=000000]
	PRESS EXAMINE THIS
	PRESS REPEAT
	PRESS EXAMINE NEXT
IF ADDRESS SWI STOP AT OTHER THAN 600000 YOU HAVE A PARITY ERROR...
GO TO STEP 3.

IF ADDRESS SWI STOP AT 600000 THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBILITIES:
	A.YOU HAVE A SPURIOUS PARITY ERROR SOMEWHERE IN CORE. YOU CAN ATTEMPT
	  TO ISOLATE IT USING THE ABOVE ROUTINE OR CALL DEC F.S..
	  IF YOU ATTEMPT TO ISOLATE IT..READ THE FIRST PART OF STEP 3 NOW,THEN
	  GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS ROUTINE.
	B.YOU MAY BE TROUBLESHOOTING A NON EXISTENT MEMORY (NXM) ERROR
	  RATHER THAN PARITY ERROR.
	C.YOU MAY HAVE MADE A ERROR IN FOLLOWING THIS PROCEDURE.
------------------------- SHEET 3 ------------------------ 2 OF 2
	HERE BECAUSE WE FOUND A PARITY ERROR IN CORE.

3.    THE FIRST THING TO DO IS DE-INTERLEAVE THE MEMORIES...IF THEY 
	ARE INTERLEAVED. TO CHECK THIS LOOK AT ADDENDUM A AND INSURE 
	ALL THE MEMORIES HAVE THE INDICATED SWITCHES IN THE DOWN POSITION.

	NOW THAT THE MEMORIES ARE NOT INTERLEAVED WE MUST FIND THE PARITY
	ERROR AGAIN...THEREFORE DO PARITY ERROR ROUTINE AGAIN [SHEET 3
	STEPS 2 & 2A ] AND RETURN BELOW TO STEP 3A.

3A.THE ADDRESS SWITCHES SHOULD = SOME VALUE < 600000.
	BITS 18 & 19 WILL NOW DIRECT US TO THE BAD MEMORY. THE POSSIBLE
	COMBINATIONS ARE:	18	19	20
				0	0	X
				0	1	X
				1	0	X
	EACH MEMORY UNIT(A,B,OR C) WILL BE EQUAL TO ONLY ONE OF THE ABOVE.
	TAKING THE ADDRESS SWITCHES BITS 18 19 ...MATCH THEM WITH ONE OF
	THE MEMORY UNITS. THIS UNIT MUST BE DESELECTED...SEE ADDENDUM B.
	THE PORT SEL DES SWITCHES (TOTAL OF 4) MUST BE PUT IN DES POSITION.
	THE MEMORY IS NOW OFF LINE.

3B.IF THE UNIT YOU DESELECTED WAS 18=1 & 19=0 (UNIT C) YOU NEED TAKE NO FURTHER
	ACTION. RETURN TO PROCEDURE AT SHEET 1 STEP 4.
	IF UNIT TAKEN OFF LINE WAS ONE OF THE OTHER TWO (UNITS A,B) WE MUST RE-
	CONFIGURE THE MEMORIES.

3C.WE HAVE TO INSURE THERE IS 128K OF SEQUENTIAL CORE MEMORY ON LINE. 
	MAKE THE SWITCHES IN UNIT C EXACTLY EQUAL TO THE SWITCHES OF THE
	DESELECTED UNIT...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORT SEL DES .
	I.E. UNIT C WILL NOW BE ADDRESED AS THE BAD UNIT WAS AND WILL ALSO
	     BE ON LINE.
	ADDENDUM'S C1 & C2 ILLUSTRATE HOW THE TWO REMAINING UNITS SHOULD BE
	ADDRESSED.

3D.WE WILL NOW SWEEP CORE TO SEE IF 128K IS ON LINE.
	PRESS RESET SWITCH
	SET STOP PAR
	SET STOP NXM
	PRESS EXAMINE THIS
	PRESS REPEAT
	PRESS EXAMINE NEXT
IF ADDRESS SWITCHES STOP WITH 400000 (BIT 18 = 1) & NXM FLAG IS UP WE WIN!
GO TO PROCEDURE AT SHEET 1 STEP 4.

IF ADDRESS SWITCHES STOP < 400000 WE LOST...CHECK TO SEE IF STEP 3C WAS DONE
PROPERLY.
------------------------- SHEET 4 -------------------------

	HERE BECAUSE WE FOUND NXM PRIOR TO 192K [ADD SWI NOT EQUAL TO 600000]
FIRST YOU MUST DE-INTERLEAVE THE MEMORIES...IF THEY ARE INTERLEAVED.
	TO DO THIS INSURE ALL MEMORY UNITS HAVE THE SWITCHES INDICATED
	IN ADDENDUM A IN THE DOWN POSITION.

1.PUSH RESET SWITCH.
  CLEAR STOP PAR SWITCH
  CLEAR ADDRESS SWITCHES
  SET STOP NXM SWITCH
  PRESS EXAMINE THIS....LOCATION 000000
  PRESS REPEAT
  PRESS EXAMINE NEXT

ADDRESS SWITCHES SHOULD STOP WITH STEPS 2-4 INDICATED. IF YOU GO TO STEP 5..
....YOU WIN. IF YOU FIND THAT YOU ARE IN A LOOP (STEPS 2-4) THEN GO TO STEP 6. 

2.IF ADDRESS IS = 000020 THEN UNIT ADDRESSED 18=0 & 19=0 IS THE PROBLEM.
  CHECK ADDENDUM C1 FOR PROPER SWI SETTINGS ON UNIT 18=0 19=0.
  PRESS RESET SWI AND GO TO STEP 1 AGAIN.

3.IF ADDRESS IS = 020000 THEN UNIT ADDRESSED 18=0 & 19=1 IS THE PROBLEM.
  CHECK ADDENDUM C2 FOR PROPER SWI SETTINGS ON UNIT 18=0 19=1.
  PRESS RESET SWI AND GO TO STEP 1 AGAIN.

4.IF ADDRESS IS = 400000 THEN UNIT ADDRESSED 18=1 & 19=0 IS THE PROBLEM
  CHECK ADDENDUM C3 FOR PROPER SWI SETTINGS ON UNIT 18=1 19=0.
  PRESS RESET SWI AND GO TO STEP 1 AGAIN.

5.IF ADDRESS IS = 600000 THEN THERE IS NO PROBLEM...AS THIS IS 192K ON LINE.
  GO BACK TO SHEET 1 STEP 4.

6.UNIT YOU ARE LOOPING ON IS BAD. DESELECT BAD UNIT BY PUTTING ALL FOUR
  PORT SEL DES SWITCHES TO THE DES POSITION...SEE ADDENDUM B FOR THEIR LOC.

6A.NOW GO TO SHEET 3(2 OF 2) STEP 3B. THERE YOU WILL RECONFIGURE THE
  MEMORIES...AS REQUIRED...EVENTUALLY GETTING BACK TO SHEET 1 STEP 4.
------------------------- SHEET 5 -------------------------
	HERE BECAUSE OF A HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CRASH

1.IF YOU WANT TO DUMP THE CRASHED SYSTEM TO DSK THEN:
	ON CTY INPUT	DSKA:/D(CR)

IF YOU GET A (CR) ON CTY AFTER ABOUT 60 SECONDS GO TO SHEET 1 STEP 11.
IF YOU GET NO RESPONSE ON CTY IN 60 THEN DO THE FOLLOWING:
	UNLOCK CONSOLE AND DATA SWITCHES
	SET SWITCH MI PROG DIS[LOCATED AT UPPER LEFT OF CONSOLE]
	SET 30(8) IN ADDRESS SWITCHES..I.E. SET ADDRESS SWI 30 &31 ONLY
	PUT 000000 000007 INTO DATA SWITCHES I.E. SWI 33 34 35 SET
	PRESS DEPOSIT THIS    SEVERAL TIMES

YOU SHOULD GET MESSAGE ON CTY		BOOTS
IF YOU DO THEN INPUT			DSKA:/D(CR)
AND GO TO SHEET 1 STEP 11.

IF YOU DO NOT GET 'BOOTS' MESSAGE ON CTY THEN:
	PRESS STOP SWITCH
	PRESS RESET SWITCH	
	GO TO SHEET 1 STEP 5
------------------------- SHEET 6 -------------------------
	HERE BECAUSE SYSTEM IS POWERED OFF...DUE TO A POWER FAILURE,
	AN OVERTEMP IN COMPUTER ROOM, A DOORS OPEN INDICATION ON KI10,
	OR A CKT BRKR TRIPPED INDICATION ON THE KI10.

NOTE:	AT THIS POINT A NUMBER OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN. IF THE SYSTEM AUTO-
	MATICALLY RECOVERS FROM THE FAULT [SAY A POWER GLITCH ] THE MONITOR
	WILL DO A POWER FAIL RESTART ... IT MAY SUCCEED/NOT SUCCEED.
	IF IT DOES, THE MAJORITY OF THE USERS SHOULD BE OK...BUT SOME
	JOBS MAY DIE WITH STRANGE INDICATIONS [PARITY ERRORS,BAD IO,ETC].

	ALSO THE PDP11 MAY STOP & NEED TO BE RESTARTED...IF SO GO TO STEP 4.

-------	IF THE SYSTEM POWERS UP AND DOWN TWICE IN QUICK SUCCESSION IT IS
	ADVISABLE THAT YOU DO THE FOLLOWING:
		A.UNLOCK THE CONSOLE SWITCHES [BOTH CONSOLE & DATA ]
		B.CLEAR THE ADDRESS SWITCHES...THEN SET ADDRESS SWITCHES 31 & 32.
		C.SET SOME VALUE INTO THE DATA SWITCHES...E.G. SW 31,32 =1
		D.PRESS DEPOSIT THIS
	THE ABOVE IS TO BRING A ORDERLY HALT TO THE MONITOR.
	IN ANY CASE AFTER THE DEPOSIT WAIT 30 SECONDS AND DO STEP E.
		E.PUSH THE POWER SWITCH ONCE...SO IT IS EVEN WITH THE OTHERS.
	THIS IS TO KEEP THE SYSTEM FROM CONTINUOUSLY POWERING UP/DOWN,DUE TO
-------	APPARENT BAD INPUT POWER FROM THE SUBSTATION.




	IN ANY CASE THE DECISION IS YOURS AS TO CRASH/RELOAD THE SYSTEM
	OR LEAVE IT RUNNING.



  IF OVERTEMP INDICATOR IS ON ...GO TO STEP 1.
  IF DOORS OPEN INDICATOR IS ON...GO TO STEP 2.
  IF CKT BRKR TRIPPED INDICATOR IS ON...GO TO STEP 3.

1.THE ONLY LIGHT THAT SHOULD BE 'ON' IN BAY 3 IS THE POWER
   LIGHT...UNLESS IT IS BURNED OUT. IN ANY CASE PUSH THE POWER SWITCH
   ONCE...SO IT IS EVEN WITH THE LAMP TEST SWITCH.
THE SYSTEM IS NOW INHIBITED FROM POWERING UP...UNTILL SUCH TIME AS YOU
PUSH THE SWITCH AGAN...AFTER THE CAUSE OF THE OVERTEMP IS DETERMINED.


2.THE 'DOORS OPEN' CKT HAS AN AUXILIARY OVERTEMP CIRCUIT WIRED INTO IT,
  THEREFORE GO TO STEP 1 .

3.THIS INDICATOR BEING ON IS BAD NEWS. TAKE NO CORRECTIVE ACTION
	OTHER THAN CALLING DEC FIELD SERVICE...635-8070

4.THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO BRING THE PDP11 BACK. DUE TO THE VARIOUS WAYS
  THAT IT CAN CRASH, ONE OR BOTH MAY BE NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY RELOAD IT
.	A.PRESS HALT SWITCH DOWN AND PRESS START SWITCH TWICE.
	    ----THIS WILL CLEAR PDP11 CPU----
	  PUT 000602 INTO THE ADDRESS SWITCHES.
	  PRESS LOAD ADDRESS-OBSERVE 602 IN LIGHTS.
	  TAKE HALT SWITCH OFF----UP, OR EVEN WITH OTHERS----.
  	  PRESS START SWITCH ONCE.

	B.ON THE CTY [LA30] INPUT
		:A BOOT11
	  THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY REBOOT THE 11 VIA OPSER
------------------------- SHEET 7 ------------------------- 1 OF 1

	HERE BECAUSE BOOTS TAPE WOULD NOT READ IN PROPERLY. 

1.ONE POSSIBLE PROBLEM IS THAT THE BOOTS TAPE YOU ARE USING IS BAD. FIND
	ANOTHER 96K [0R 128K] AND GO BACK TO SHEET 1 STEP 5.
	IF THEY DO NOT WORK EITHER THEN GO TO NEXT STEP.

2.SET READ-IN DEVICE SWITCHES 4 5 & 6 ONLY----TAKE 9 OFF.
	GET A MAGTAPE LABELED   MAGRIM   AND MOUNT IT ON DRIVE 0.
--------WE ARE NOW GOING TO TRY AND GET THE MONITOR OFF THE MAGRIM TAPE.

3.MTA0 SHOULD BE ENABLED AND READY TO GO.
	PRESS RESET SWITCH
	PRESS READ IN SWITCH

	YOU SHOULD SEE THE MAG TAPE MOVE TAPE...IF IT DOES GO TO SHEET 1 STEP 12.

	IF IT DOES NOT MOVE THEN:
	PRESS THE STOP & RESET SWITCHES.......AND CALL DEC FIELD SERVICE
------------------------- SHEET 8 -------------------------

	HERE TO FIND POWER FAIL LAMP AND HOW TO TURN IT OFF

1.  BAY 3[OPERATOR'S CONSOLE] TOP HALF..THE BOTTOM ROW OF LAMPS
	THE XXX LAMP FROM THE LEFT IS THE POWER FAIL.

2.  IF IT IS NOT ON-AND LAMP TEST LIGHT'S IT AS OK- GO TO STEP X.
	IF IT IS ON DO THE FOLLOWING:
	UNLOCK CONSOLE AND DATA SWITCHES (IF NOT ALREADY)
	INTO THE DATA SWITCHES DEPOSIT 700600 400000.
	--THIS EQUALS SWITCHES 0 1 2 9 10 AND 18  ON--
	PRESS RESET SWITCH
	PRESS XCT SWITCH (NEXT TO RESET SWITCH)
    THE POWER FAIL LAMP SHOULD GO OUT.
    IF IT DOES NOT,RECHECK THE DATA SWITCHES AND TRY AGAIN,IF 
    IT STILL DOES NOT GO OUT CALL DEC FIELD SERVICE.

    IF THE LAMP GOES OUT IT IS ADVISABLE TO CLEAR CORE AT THIS TIME
    AS THERE MAY BE PARITY ERRORS AS A RESULT OF THE POWER FAILURE.

    TO CLEAR CORE DO A DEPOSIT NEXT FUNCTION:
	PRESS RESET SWITCH
	CLEAR BOTH ADDRESS AND DATA SWITCHES
	PRESS DEPOSIT THIS
	PRESS PAR STOP, NXM STOP, AND REPEAT SWITCHES
	PRESS DEPOSIT NEXT SWITCH

    THE ADDRESS SWITCHES WILL STOP WITH 18 AND 19 ON A ONE
