 RENOVATION OF TELETYPES (15-JUN-77):

	SOME OF OUR TELETYPES (TTY) ARE NOW SIX YEARS OLD.  SINCE THE 
NORMAL LIFE OF THESE UNITS IS 8 TO 10 YEARS UNDER REGULAR USE, AND
SINCE WE USE THEM ABOUT 25% HARDER THAN NORMAL, I WOULD LIKE TO START
A SYSTAMATIC REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.  
	I FEEL A GRADUAL REPLACEMENT IS DESIRABLE OVER A GROSS
REPLACEMENT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE.  ALTHOUGH THE OLDER UNITS
MAY BE KEPT RUNNING, THE AMOUNT OF DOWN-TIME AND THE NUMBER
OF REPAIR CALLS INCREASES RAPIDLY.
