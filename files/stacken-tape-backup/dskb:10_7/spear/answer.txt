Introduction

SPEAR is a library of programs which provide support to both
Field Service and customers.

Four of the functions (Analyze, Summarize, Retrieve, and Compute) are
designed to help you evaluate system performance and analyze the
contents of system event files. 

A fifth function, Instruct, is designed to help you learn to use the
Spear Library to calculate system availability and isolate
intermittent system failures. 

Another function, Theory, is used in conjunction with Analyze to give
more detailed explanation about the theories Analyze produces.   In
addition there is a seventh function for 36 bit machines called KLERR.

Instruct also describes the Guaranteed Uptime Program and NOTIFY,
which relate to system uptime and reliability.

Type /BREAK to leave or press the RETURN key for further information.
@@return_key
The RETURN key - Instruct is frame oriented. That is, it displays one
idea, or frame of information at a time. Thus, you may study each frame
for as long as you like. Then, when you are ready, you can proceed to
the next frame of information by pressing the RETURN key. Try it.  
@@
@@return_key_a
The RETURN key (an additional use) - The RETURN key also serves as a
universal response terminator. All responses to Instruct or any other
Spear Library function must be terminated by pressing the RETURN key.
Throughout this text the symbol <cr>, represents the RETURN key.

Remember, from now on press the RETURN key to proceed to the next frame.
@@
@@backspace
The BACKSPACE key - Occasionally, you may want to backup and review a
previous frame of information. If you want, you may do so by pressing 
the BACKSPACE key. If your terminal does not have a BACKSPACE key you
can perform the same function by typing /Reverse<CR>.

If you'd like, you may try the BACKSPACE feature now. Otherwise, press
the RETURN key to continue.
@@
@@help_response
HELP  - All Spear Library Dialogs (including Instruct) support the HELP
feature. Thus, any time you are unsure of how to proceed or respond to a
particular prompt, you can type HELP. Spear will respond by displaying a
one page (22 lines max) message that explains all acceptable responses.

Question mark (?) - All Spear Library Dialogs (again including Instruct)
also support the question mark feature. Thus, if you only want a list of
the acceptable responses, you can type: ?. Spear will respond by listing
the acceptable responses.
@@
@@delete_key
The DELETE key - Alphanumeric typing errors may be corrected by pressing
the Delete key. Each time you press the Delete key the last character
left in your response will be deleted. After deleting the typing error
re-enter the correct response.
@@ 
@@quest_ans
Questions and Answers - Occasionally, Instruct will ask you a question.
Sometimes the question will require that you input text; your name or
mailing address, for example. Most of the time, however, the question
will have an implied Yes/No or True/False answer. Yes/No answers may be
abbreviated to Y or N. Likewise, True/False answers may be abbreviated
to T or F. All answers must, however, be terminated by pressing the
RETURN key.

Do you understand everything so far ?

@@
@@review
Ok. Let's review the Instruct interface protocol:

Use the RETURN key to terminate all responses and to advance to the next
frame of information.

Use the BACKSPACE key or type /REVERSE to review a previous frame.

Type: HELP any time that you are unsure of your options.

Use the DELETE key to correct alphanumeric typing errors.

Answer questions by typing either Yes or No, or True or False; which
ever is appropriate.

OK?

Course Description

The Instruct course is designed to help you use the Spear Library to
isolate intermittent system failures. The course consists of three main
modules:

 1. Fault Isolation Techniques - This module describes the nature of
    intermittent faults and discusses some of the most common methods
    used to isolate intermittent system and subsystem failures.

 2. System Event File Organization and Content - this module describes
    the overall organization and content of TOPS-10, TOPS-20, and
    VAX/VMS system event files.

 3. Spear Library Functions - This module explains the how to use each
    of the Spear maintenance functions: Analyze, Retrieve, Summarize,
    and Compute.

Each module consists of an introduction and a menu of subordinate 
subjects. When appropriate, the subordinate subjects are further broken
down into introductions and menus. Thus, Instruct can be used as both a
tutorial and a reference tool.
@@
@@course_des_a
If you want to use Instruct as a tutorial (i.e., sequence through the
course much like you would read a book) you can do so using the RETURN
key. You will proceed to the module introduction, then the menu, then
the first subject on the menu, followed by the next subject, etc.

If you want to use Instruct as a reference tool, then, instead of
pressing the RETURN key at the menu, select the subject number that
intrests you. You will proceed directly to that subject. If, after
investigating the subject, you want to return to the menu, type MENU.
@@
@@break
The /BREAK switch - You may leave Instruct any time you wish by typing
/Break<CR>. If you have established a student ID, Instruct will keep
track of where you left off. Then, when you return, you can specify your
student ID and pickup at the point where you left off. If you do not
have a student ID, however, then you are left with two choices; you can
either start all over again, or you can use the REFERENCE ID. To use the
the Reference ID Type: INSTRUCT ID REFERENCE<cr> at the SPEAR prompt.

Example:    SPEAR> Instruct ID REF<cr>


The difference between a student ID and the Reference ID is: the student
ID is used (like a personal book mark) to keep track of where you are in
the course, the Reference ID is not. The Reference ID simply allows you
to skip over this introduction and go directly to the course menu.
@@
@@new_student
Your student ID is your personal book marker in Instruct. After you have
established your student ID you may leave Instruct any time you wish.
Then, when you want to return, type: INSTRUCT ID xxxxxx<cr> in response
to the SPEAR prompt (where xxxxxx is your student ID).

  Example:  SPEAR>Instruct ID xxxxxx<cr>


If you wish to establish a student ID enter any alphanumeric string that
you are not likely to forget; your name or employee badge number, for
example. Then, press the RETURN key. From that point on, Instruct will
keep track of where you are in the course. If, however, you do not wish
to establish a student ID at this time type: REFERENCE<cr> in response
to this prompt.
