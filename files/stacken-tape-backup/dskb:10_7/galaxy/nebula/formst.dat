$! 		FORMSTYPE.DAT: a file of types of print forms.
$! 			MUST BE RESIDENT IN SYS$MANAGER
$! *************************************************************************************************
$! This is a data file that records the names of legal forms and equates them to a form number.
$! 
$! Modified  8-Nov-83 by Paul Kyzivat to add definitions for the xerox 8700.
$! Modified  4-Apr-84 by Paul Kyzivat to add white and blue card stock.
$! Modified 30-Aug-84 by Paul Kyzivat to reformat and reassign numbers in preparation for V4.
$! 
$! The following number assignment system is used in this file:
$! 	0-49	used for defaults and random forms unrelated to the 8700 printers.
$! 	50-74	forms for the 8700 with simplex/duplex not explicitly in the form name.
$!	75-99	undefined
$! 	100-124	alternate form names for the 8700, not fitting any other category.
$!	125-149	undefined
$! 	150-174	same as 50-74, but explicitly SIMPLEX.
$!	175-199	undefined
$! 	200-224	same as 50-75, but explicitly DUPLEX.
$!	225-255	undefined
$! 
$! This file can be made compatible with V4 by changing each leading "%" to "$ DEFINE/FORM".
$! 
$! This file is also processed by the 8700 symbiont.  It utilizes the "stock" name to associate
$! a form with its internal data about the form.  It also checks the "desc" field for the presence
$! of the words "SIMPLEX" or "DUPLEX" to determine whether to image both sides of the form.
$! If these fields are not found, defaults prevail.
