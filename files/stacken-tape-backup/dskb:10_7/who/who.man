   .WHO:JOB file=spec              !(JOB mode)

   A mode can also be selected by the use of the /MODE switch which takes arguments
   WHO,  JOB, or LINE.  JOB mode primarily selects jobs, and lists attributes about
   them, such as users PPN, name,  program,  runtime,  etc.   LINE  mode  primarily
   selects  lines,  and  lists attributes about them, such as node, line, speed and
   terminal type.

   3.2  TYPEOUT SWITCHES        TYPEOUT SWITCHES

   The following switches can be included on the command line to control the format
   of  the  line  mode output.  In all cases, these switches are global, and can be
   specified anywhere in the command line and have the same effect.



   3.2.1  /DPY:n:m

   This switch displays the selected lines on a video terminal  in  DPY  mode  with
   cursor  update  of  the  data.  If :n is specified, n is treated as a sleep scan
   between display updates.  The default is 10 seconds.  If :n is 0, DPY mode  will
   not  be  selected.   If  :M is specified, m in the number of times to repeat the
   display.  The default is to repeat forever.  While in DPY  mode,  the  following
   single characters can be typed to control the output on the display:  more                                                                         m



   3.2.2  /ERNONE   3

   This switch generates a fatal error when no lines match the selection criterion.   T
   Either   "?WHONTM  Line  not  connected"  or  "?WHOARC  All  lines  rejected  by
   constraints" message is generated as appropriate.  This is the default.



   3.2.3  /FAST

   This  switch  displays  fast  information  about  the  selected   lines.    This
   information is in the format:

   This switch selects the display of incremental line information for  the  fields
   that  are  incremental  in  nature.   /NOINCREMENTAL  displays the total fields.
   Fields that are incremental are input character count, output  character  count,
   break  character count, and command count.  If /REPEAT or /DPY are specified, it
   should be noted that the first display will have zeros for all  the  incremental
   fields, as no previous values are available to compute them.

   information (A U job 17).



   3.2.9  /OKNONE

   This switch requests that  no  message  be  printed  when  no  lines  match  the
   selection  criterion.   The default is /ERNONE which will generate a fatal error
   when no lines match the selection criterion.



   3.2.10  /PERFORMANCE and /NOPERFORMANCE

   This switch displays performance ratios with various fields related to the line.
   The current ratios are:

   mode  information  is  printed.   If  /SUMMARY and /PRINT is given, the selected
   lines will be output, as well as  the  summary  at  the  end,  and  if  /NOPRINT
   (default) is given, only the summary information will be displayed.



   3.2.12  /REPEAT:N:M

   This switch repeats the display of the  selected  lines  at  the  selected  time
   interval.   If  :n  is  specified,  n is treated as a sleep scan between display
   updates.  The default is 10 seconds.  If :n  is  0,  repeat  mode  will  not  be
   selected.   If  :M is specified, m in the number of times to repeat the display.
   The default is to repeat forever.

   WHO provides the sophisticated used with complete control of the output display.
   The exact formats of the display line, as well as optional headings and footings
   can be specified.



   4.1  FORMAT LIST        FORMAT LIST

   A number of format control switches take a  "format-list"  as  an  argument.   A
   "format-list"  is  a  list  of  parameters  separated  by commas and inclosed in
   parentheses.  Each parameter is either  a  text  string  or  a  switch  specific
   keyword.   Text  string  parameters  are simply ascii strings enclosed in double
   quotations (").  Keywords must be from  the  legal  set  of  keywords,  and  can
   include several arguments of the form keyword:arg1:arg2:arg3.  All arguments are
   optional, and can be omitted.   ARG1  is  the  default  fieldwidth  of  for  the
   specified keyword.  ARG2 is a keyword to control the justification of the field.
   It can be either LEFT (for left justification in  the  specified  field  width),
   CENTER  (for  centering  in  the  specified  field  width), or RRIGHT (for right
   justification in the specified field width).  ARG3 is the number  of  spaces  to
   follow  the  field (only valid when the fieldwidth is zero).  If any argument is
   omitted, a default depending on the nature of the keyword field destined  to  be
   output is used.



   4.2  FORMAT LIST SWITCHES        FORMAT LIST SWITCHES

   The following switches take a format-list an an argument.  For  a  list  of  the
   keywords  that  each  format-list  can  be  composed  of, refer to the following
   section.



   4.2.1  /FINAL:(format-list)

   This format switch provides a format-controlled line to be output  once  at  the
   end  of  all  selected  jobs  or  lines.   It  is  useful  for including trailer
   information.   For  example,   [10,]/FINAL:list1,/PROGRAM:WHO   (equivalent   to                                      ]
   [10,],/PROGRAM:WHO/FINAL:list1  since  FINAL  is  a  global switch) would output       ]
   format-list 1 after listing all project 10 jobs, and all  jobs  running  program

   FORMAT LIST SWITCHES


   WHO.



   4.2.2  /FOOTING:(format-list)

   This format switch provides a format-controlled line to be output at the end  of
   each  list  of  job/line  specifications, and thus, is a "file" specific switch.
   For   example,   [10,]/FOOTING:list1,/PROGRAM:WHO/FOOTING:list2   would   output                        ]
   format-list 1 after listing all project 10 jobs, and format list 2 after listing
   all jobs running program WHO.



   4.2.3  /HEADING:(format-list)

   This format switch provides a format-controlled line to be  output  before  each
   list  of  job/line  specifications,  and thus, si also a "file" specific switch.
   For   example,   [10,]/HEADING:list1,/PROGRAM:WHO/HEADING:list2   would   output                        ]
   format-list  1  before  listing  all  project  10 jobs, and format list 2 before
   listings all jobs running program WHO.



   4.2.4  /INITIAL:(format-list)

   This format switch provides a format-controlled line to be  output  once  before
   the start of all the selected jobs or lines.  It is useful for including titles,
   or other information.  For example, [10,]/INITIAL:list1,/PROGRAM:WHO (equivalent                                           ]
   to  [10,],/PROGRAM:WHO/INITIAL:list1  since  INITIAL  is  a global switch) would           ]
   output format-list 1 before listing all project 10 jobs, and  all  jobs  running
   program WHO.



   4.2.5  /FORMAT:(format-list)

   This format switch controls the detailed listing for each job.  It is  a  global
   switch,  and  can  be  used  to taylor the output to display exactly the desired
   fields for each job.  The switches  /VFAST,  /FAST,  /NORMAL  and  /SLOW  select
   several common detail line formats.



   4.3  DEFAULT FORMAT CONTROL        DEFAULT FORMAT CONTROL

   The following switches can be used to control the default global justifications.
   However,  any  specified as ARG2 to any of the above switches, will override the
   defaults.

   DEFAULT FORMAT CONTROL


   4.3.1  /BLANK

   This default format control switch suppresses  the  output  of  any  field  that
   normally would be blank.  Thus, this can destroy the neat, columnized output.



   4.3.2  /DEFAULT

   This default format control switch selects that  the  default  justification  be
   used for each field.



   4.3.3  /FIX

   This default format control switch forces all fields to  be  output  in  strict,
   fixed length columnized areas.



   4.3.4  /FLOAT

   This default format control switch allows all fields to be output in  completely
   free  floating format.  Generally, by default, each field will be separated from
   the previous field by exactly one space.

                                   ACTION SWITCHES                                   ACTION SWITCHES



   The following action switches may be used to force various actions on the target
   job  or  line.   Some  switches require a target job, and use the job (if in JOB
   mode), or the job owning the terminal (if in LINE mode), others require a target
   line,  and use the line number of the selected job (if in JOB mode), or the line
   number (if in LINE mode).

   All of these functions can be done to any job with the same programmer number as
   the  commanding  job,  or  to  any terminal owned by the commanding job.  If the
   target job/line does not meet one of those criterion, POKE or  WHEEL  privileges
   are required.

   In all cases except for /NETWORK:CONNECT  the  action  is  preformed  after  the
   jobs/lines  are  selected,  and  the  information  displayed.   In  the  case of
   /NETWORK:CONNECT, the lines are selected, and information  displayed  after  the
   lines are connected.



   5.1  INPUT/OUTPUT FUNCTIONS        INPUT/OUTPUT FUNCTIONS

   5.1.1  /FORCE:command

   This switch uses the FRCUUO monitor call to force  a  command  on  the  selected
   jobs.   If  the  job  is detached, the switch is ignored.  Legal forced commands
   are:

           .HALT       Force a ^C (stop the stop with control-C trapping)
           .BYE        Detach the job
           .HELLO      Run the INITIA program
           .RESTA      Type the system restart greeting
           KJOB        Log the job out
           INITIA      Run the INITIA program
           .FCONT      Force a CONTINUE
           .TYPE       Retype the line (control-R)
           USESTA      Type statistics (control-T)
           .NETLDR     Force run the NETLDR program
           HALT        HALT the job regardless of control-C trapping
           CTEST       Force a CTEST command (for patching)

   INPUT/OUTPUT FUNCTIONS


   5.1.2  /INPUT:"string"

   This switch inputs the "string" into the terminal buffer, as though it was typed
   on  the  terminal.   Control  characters  can  be  imbedded by inserting them in
   up-arrow form.



   5.1.3  /OUTPUT:"string"

   This switch outputs the "string" on the terminal.   Control  characters  can  be
   imbedded by inserting them in up-arrow form.

   This switch outputs the "string" on the terminal,  prefixed  with  the  standard
   "<bell>;;TTYnnn - " leader.



   5.2  NETWORK FUNCTIONS        NETWORK FUNCTIONS

   5.2.1  /NETWORK:CONNECT

   This switch connects all the specified terminals to the host system.  The  /NODE
   switch  must  be  given,  and the node name cannot be wildcarded.  If a specific
   line is given (/NODE:name_line) only that terminal is connected, if no  line  is
   given (/NODE:name) all terminals on that node will be connected.



   5.2.2  /NETWORK:DISCONNECT

   This switch sends a disconnect message  to  the  node  to  which  each  selected
   terminal is connected to.  If a job is on the line, it is detached.



   5.3  SETUUO FUNCTIONS        SETUUO FUNCTIONS

   The following arguments can  be  specified  to  the  /SETUUO  switch.   Multiple
   /SETUUO  switches  with  different arguments can be specified.  Each argument to
   the  /SETUUO  switch  is  a  keyword  followed  by  another  argument  (such  as
   /SETUUO:DSKFUL:PAUSE to set disk-full pause for the job).

   The following switches may be placed on the output file specification to control
   it.



   6.2.1  /APPEND and /NOAPPEND

   This switch controls whether or not the output file is appended to.  The default
   (/NOAPPEND) is to supersede the output file for the first command, and append to
   it each time if /REPEAT is specified.  /APPEND will always append to the  output
   file.



   6.2.2  /ERSUPERSEDE
