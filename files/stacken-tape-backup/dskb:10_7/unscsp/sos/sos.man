SOS is the Son Of Stopgap text editor.  This file briefly describes each
of the SOS commands and its use.  For help on a particular command, type
"H,<command name>" to SOS.  For example, information on all  alter  mode
commands  is available by typing "H,A" to SOS.  Help for the various SOS

Term    Meaning

n               a positive integer.
+n              a positive integer.
-n              a negative integer.
range           is an SOS line range specification.  It is made up of  a
                starting  and  an  ending point separated by a colon.  A
                line number specification is given on each side  of  the
                colon.   There  are several special elements that may be
                used in line number specifications in  place  of  or  in
                addition to an actual line number.  These are:

                #       is  the  first  line  of  the  last  line  range
                        specification given.
                %       is the last line  of  the  last  insert  command
                        given.
                .       is the current line number if used to  the  left
                        of  a  slash, or the current page if used to the
                        right of a slash.  This may be omitted  on  most
                        commands  (except  "R"  and "D" in NOVICE mode).
                        Thus, "A.<CR>" and "A<CR>" are equivalent.
                ^       is the first line on the current page if used to
                        the  left  of  a  slash or the first page in the
                        current file if used to the right of a slash.
                *       is the last line on the current page if used  to
                        the  left  of  a  slash  or the last page in the
                        current file if used to the right of a slash.
                !       may be suffixed to a line number or one  of  the
                        above  characters and followed by a digit giving
                        the number of lines.   Thus,  ".!5"  means  five
                        lines starting at the current line.
                BF      is the beginning of file (same as ^/^).
                EF      is the end of file (same as */*)  when  used  as
                        the  second  argument to the range specifier, or
                        is the entire file (same as ^/^:*/*)  when  used
                        as a range specifier by itself.

                Arithmetic expressions using plus and minus may also  be
                included  in  a  line number specification.  Thus, ".-5"
                means five lines before the current line, ".+4" means  4
                lines beyond the current line, and ".-2!4" means start 2
                lines before the current line and go for 4 lines.

                In addition, a line number specification may be suffixed
                with  a  slash  and  a  page number specification.  Page
                numbers can be constructed in a manner similar  to  line
                numbers.   As  an  example,  "^!5/47"  means  five lines
                starting at the first line on  page  47.   If  the  page
                specification is omitted, the current page is assumed.

                Thus an example of a line range specification  would  be
                "10/1:*/999", meaning line 10 on page 1 through the last
                line on page 999.

                A  search  string  specified  between  ALTmodes  may  be
                specified  in  place  of  a  line  number specification.
                Commands using this must be terminated with  1  <CR>  to
                end  the search string, and 1 additional <CR> to end the
                command  instead   of   the   usual   1   <CR>.    Thus,
                "$foo$<CR><CR>"  means  the  next  line  containing  the
                string "foo".

$               is the symbol for the ESCape or ALTmode  key.   If  this
                character  is typed in response to the SOS "*", the line
                preceding the current line will be printed.

<CR>            is the symbol for the Carriage Return key.

<LF>            is the symbol for the Line Feed key.  If <LF>  is  typed
                in  response  to  the  SOS  "*",  the line following the
                current line will be printed.

<STRING>        is used to represent a valid search  string.   A  search
                string  consists of up to 20 character strings separated
                by <CR> and terminated by an ALTmode.  The search string
                may  contain  certain  special characters to control the
                search.   The  S(ubstitute)  command  accepts  two  such
                arguments  -  the first is the string to look for, while
                the second is a string to replace the first one.   These
                special characters are preceeded by a control-E (^E).  A
                detailed explanation of the pattern match characters can
                be found under ^E.

^^              is also used as a flag in this file for  the  SOS  "H,x"
                command.  ^^ may be encountered if the monitor command

                .HELP SOS

                is used.  It is not part  of  the  text  and  should  be
                ignored.



A/NEWALTER
Purpose:        The "A" command causes SOS to enter intraline edit mode.
                Once  in  this  mode, any of the intraline edit commands
                are valid.  Unless otherwise noted,  an  intraline  edit
                command  may  be preceded by an integer and/or a sign to
                modify its function.  In  general,  a  positive  integer
                preceding   a   command   means   "the   next  <integer>
                occurrences", and a negative integer means "the previous
                <integer>   occurrences".   If  no  integer  precedes  a
                command, 1 is assumed.  At  all  times,  the  cursor  is
                positioned  between  2 characters or between a character
                and one end of the line.  The cursor  will  be  visually
                positioned   on   top  of  the  character  it  logically
                precedes.

                A "word" in the following discussion means any number of
                consecutive  letters,  numbers,  periods, percent signs,
                dollar signs, and any surrounding tabs or blanks.

                Examples:  Cx Change  next  character  to  "x".   4Cabcd
                Change  the next 4 characters to "abcd".  -Cz Change the
                previous character to "z".  -2Cgo  Change  the  previous
                two characters to "go".

                There are  two  classes  of  alter  commands,  immediate
                action, and those that require a unit and a mode.  These
                two types are discussed below.

Syntax: A range
                Alter the line or lines specified by "range".

                A list of immediate action commands follows.

Command Function

B               Insert a blank at the current cursor position.
C               Change the next character to be whatever is typed  after
                the "C".
D               Delete the character under the cursor.
E               Exit alter mode on the current line;  do not  print  the
                rest  of  line.   All  changes  made before "E" is typed
                become permanent.
I               Enter insert mode.  Allows an  arbitrary  string  to  be
                entered  starting  at  the  current  cursor position and
                ending with an ALTmode or ESCape.
J               Join the next line to the end of the  current  line  and
                position the cursor at the start of the joined text.
N               Print the rest of the current  line,  make  the  changes
                indicated, and enter alter mode on the next line.
O               Insert one character in the text.  "nOc" will insert "n"
                occurrences  of  "c"  starting  at  the  current  cursor
                position.  "-nOc" is illegal.
P               Print the rest of the line, and then  reprint  the  line
                number and the line up to the current cursor position.
Q               Quit alter mode.  None of the changes made to  the  line
                are retained.
T               Insert a tab at the current cursor position.
X               Extend.  Move to the end of the current line  and  enter
                insert  mode.   T may be terminated by typing ALTmode or
                ESCape.  If a <CR> is typed while in eXtend mode, a  new
                line will be started if use of the global line increment
                will allow room for a new line.  If there is not  enough
                room  for  a  new  line, <CR> returns you to SOS command
                mode.  The <LF> character may  be  used  to  insert  new
                lines  and  have SOS compute a new line number that will
                fit.  The eXtend command may  be  prefixed  by  a  count
                which will be interpreted as a suggested line increment.
'               Insert the control equivalent  of  the  character  typed
                after  the  apostrophe.   For  example,  "'Z"  inserts a
                Control-Z in the line.
+               Insert a copy of the  character  preceding  the  current
                cursor  position.   "n+"  inserts "n" copies of whatever
                character precedes the current cursor  position.   "-n+"
                is illegal.
/               Transpose the next 2 characters.
;               Break the line at the current cursor position and assign
                a  new line number to the rest of the line.  If there is
                no room for a new line, "%ORDER" is printed and the  ";"
                is ignored.
<CR>            Type the rest of the line and end the alter, making  all
                indicated changes to the line.
<LF>            If in  insert  mode,  break  the  line  at  the  current
                position and start a new line with whatever is left.  If
                no room remains for another  line  number,  "%ORDER"  is
                printed,  and  the  <LF>  is  ignored.  If not in insert
                mode, <LF> is treated as <CR>.
^R (Control-R)  Retype the current line up through  the  current  cursor
                position.
RUBOUT          Back up the cursor 1 character if not  in  insert  mode.
                If in insert mode, it erases the previous character.
^U (Control-U)  Cancel all alterations on the  current  line  and  start
                over.
^W (Control-W)  Backspace one word.

                The other class of alter commands work with  a  function
                to  preform,  and  a unit (range) to perform it to.  The
                general format of these  commands  is  <optional  signed
                repeat count number> <function> <unit>.

                The functions are:

K               Delete characters
R               Replace characters (delete and enter insert mode)
V               InVert case of characters
^               Upper case characters
\               Lower case characters
<null>          Move the cursor position

                The units are:

<space>         Single character
F<string>       Up to <string>
G<string>       Up to and including <string>
L               Entire line
M<string>       Only to <string>
S<char>         Up to <char>
W               Word
Z               To end of line

                For example, KW would delete a word, -3KW  would  delete
                the  preceeding  three  words,  KSx  would  delete up to
                character  "x",  RW  would  replace  a  word,  W   (null
                function)  would skip a word, RZ would replace to end of
                line, etc.



A/OLDALTER
Purpose:        The "A" command causes SOS to enter intraline edit mode.
                Once  in  this  mode, any of the intraline edit commands
                are valid.  Unless otherwise noted,  an  intraline  edit
                command  may  be preceded by an integer and/or a sign to
                modify its function.  In  general,  a  positive  integer
                preceding   a   command   means   "the   next  <integer>
                occurrences", and a negative integer means "the previous
                <integer>   occurrences".   If  no  integer  precedes  a
                command, 1 is assumed.  At  all  times,  the  cursor  is
                positioned  between  2 characters or between a character
                and one end of the line.  The cursor  will  be  visually
                positioned   on   top  of  the  character  it  logically
                precedes.

                A "word" in the following discussion means any number of
                consecutive  letters,  numbers,  periods, percent signs,
                dollar signs, and any surrounding tabs or blanks.

                Examples:  Cx Change  next  character  to  "x".   4Cabcd
                Change  the next 4 characters to "abcd".  -Cz Change the
                previous character to "z".  -2Cgo  Change  the  previous
                two characters to "go".

                The table below gives some of the more  frequently  used
                alter  mode characters and their functions.  The unit on
                which the character operates is given at the top of each
                column,  and  the  effect  of a given character is given
                down the left side.  Thus "X" will replace the next word
                by  deleting  it  and entering insert mode, allowing the
                user to type the replacement word.

                |Character|  Word   |  Line   |Character| String  |

Syntax: A range
                Alter the line or lines specified by "range".

                A list of these commands follows.

Command Function

B               Insert a blank at the current cursor position.
C               Change the next character to be whatever is typed  after
                the "C".
D               Delete the character under the cursor.
E               Exit alter mode on the current line;  do not  print  the
                rest  of  line.   All  changes  made before "E" is typed
                become permanent.
F               Find a string.  Type "F<string  to  look  for>$".   This
                will  look  for a string and place the cursor before the
                start of the string if successful;   if  not  successful
                the  bell is sounded at the user's terminal.  RUBOUT and
                Control-U  may  be  used  to  erase  incorrectly   typed
                characters when entering the search string.  The special
                search control  characters  used  with  the  F(ind)  and
                S(ubstitute)  commands  are  not  allowed  in alter mode
                search strings.
G               Identical to "F", except the cursor is positioned at the
                end of the string.
H               Hack (delete) the rest of  the  line  and  enter  insert
                mode.
I               Enter insert mode.  Allows an  arbitrary  string  to  be
                entered  starting  at  the  current  cursor position and
                ending with an ALTmode or ESCape.
J               Join the next line to the end of the  current  line  and
                position the cursor at the start of the joined text.
K               Search  for  the  single  character  typed  after   "K",
                deleting  all  characters  up to, but not including, the
                specified character.  If the  character  is  not  found,
                nothing  is  deleted,  the  cursor is not moved, and the
                bell is sounded at the user's terminal.
L               List rest of line, reprint the  line  number  and  place
                cursor at start of line.
M               Similar to "F", but deletes the string and enters insert
                mode.
N               Print the rest of the current  line,  make  the  changes
                indicated, and enter alter mode on the next line.
O               Insert one character in the text.  "nOc" will insert "n"
                occurrences  of  "c"  starting  at  the  current  cursor
                position.  "-nOc" is illegal.
P               Print the rest of the line, and then  reprint  the  line
                number and the line up to the current cursor position.
Q               Quit alter mode.  None of the changes made to  the  line
                are retained.
R               Replace.  Deletes the specified number of characters and
                enters insert mode.
S               Search for the character typed after the "S"  and  place
                the cursor before it.
T               Extend.  Move to the end of the current line  and  enter
                insert  mode.   T may be terminated by typing ALTmode or
                ESCape.  If a <CR> is typed while in eXtend mode, a  new
                line will be started if use of the global line increment
                will allow room for a new line.  If there is not  enough
                room  for  a  new  line, <CR> returns you to SOS command
                mode.  The <LF> character may  be  used  to  insert  new
                lines  and  have SOS compute a new line number that will
                fit.  The eXtend command may  be  prefixed  by  a  count
                which will be interpreted as a suggested line increment.
V               Invert the case of all letters in the next word.
W               Skip word.  Places the cursor at the start of  the  next
                word when moving right, or at the start of the last word
                skipped when moving left.
X               Delete a word and enter insert mode.
Y               Similar to "F", but deletes the string.
Z               Delete a word.
!               Similar to "K", but enters insert  mode  after  deleting
                all  text  up to, but not including, the character typed
                after the "!".
"               Invert the case of all characters up  to  the  character
                typed after the quote.
'               Insert the control equivalent  of  the  character  typed
                after  the  apostrophe.   For  example,  "'Z"  inserts a
                Control-Z in the line.
#               InVert the case  of  all  letters  from  current  cursor
                position to the end of line.
+               Insert a copy of the  character  preceding  the  current
                cursor  position.   "n+"  inserts "n" copies of whatever
                character precedes the current cursor  position.   "-n+"
                is illegal.
/               Transpose the next 2 characters.
:               Delete the rest of the line.
;               Break the line at the current cursor position and assign
                a  new line number to the rest of the line.  If there is
                no room for a new line, "%ORDER" is printed and the  ";"
                is ignored.
\               Transpose the previous 2 characters.
^               Invert the case of  the  next  character,  if  it  is  a
                letter.
<CR>            Type the rest of the line and end the alter, making  all
                indicated changes to the line.
<LF>            If in  insert  mode,  break  the  line  at  the  current
                position and start a new line with whatever is left.  If
                no room remains for another  line  number,  "%ORDER"  is
                printed,  and  the  <LF>  is  ignored.  If not in insert
                mode, <LF> is treated as <CR>.
^R (Control-R)  Retype the current line up through  the  current  cursor
                position.
RUBOUT          Back up the cursor 1 character if not  in  insert  mode.
                If in insert mode, it erases the previous character.
SPACE           Advance the cursor 1 character if not  in  insert  mode;
                inserts a blank in the text if used in insert mode.
TAB (Control-I) Move the cursor to the end of the current line.
^U (Control-U)  Cancel all alterations on the  current  line  and  start
                over.
^W (Control-W)  Same as -W.



B
Purpose:        The B  command  causes  SOS  to  establish  the  current
                position  as  the  line  preceding the first line in the
                file.  It is identical to the BF command.

Syntax: B

                     Position the line pointer to lie prior to the first
                line in the file.



BF
Purpose:        The BF command  causes  SOS  to  establish  the  current
                position  as  the  line  preceding the first line in the
                file.  It is identical to the B command.

Syntax: BF

                     Position the line pointer to lie prior to the first
                line in the file.



BP
Purpose:        The BP command  causes  SOS  to  establish  the  current
                position  as  the  line  preceding the first line on the
                current page.

Syntax: BP

                     Position the line pointer to lie prior to the first
                line on the current page.



C
Purpose:        Allows copying of lines from within the current file  or
                from another file.

Syntax: C n,range,inc1,inc2

                     Copy the lines given by "range" after line "n" with
                an  increment  of  "inc1" to be used before a page mark,
                and "inc2" to be used after a  page  mark.   "inc1"  and
                "inc2" are optional.
        C n=file,range,inc1,inc2
                Copy the lines given by "range"  from  "file"  into  the
                file  being  edited  after  line "n".  "inc1" and "inc2"
                have the same meanings given above.
        C n=file
                Enter search mode on "file".  User can use  any  command
                that  does  not  alter  "file"  to  find the lines to be
                copied.  When the lines are located, type  "E"  and  SOS
                will print "Source Lines=".  The user then types a range
                of lines to  be  copied  into  the  file  being  edited.
                "Range"  may  be suffixed by "inc1" and "inc2" as above.
                If "EQ" is used to exit the file,  SOS  will  assume  no
                lines  are to be copied and will simply return to normal
                edit mode.
        C n=file/S
                Same as "C n=file".



CC
Purpose:        Allows copying of  lines  from  the  second  file  of  a
                co-edit pair into the first member of the pair.

Syntax: CC n,range,inc1,inc2

                     Co-Copy the lines given by "range" from file 2 into
                file  1 placing them after line "n" with an increment of
                "inc1" to be used before a page mark, and "inc2"  to  be
                used after a page mark.  "inc1" and "inc2" are optional.



CT
Purpose:        Allows transferring of lines from the second file  of  a
                co-edit pair into the first member of the pair.

Syntax: CT n,range,inc1,inc2

                     Co-transfer the lines given by "range" from file  2
                into  file  1  placing  them  after  line  "n"  with  an
                increment of "inc1" to be used before a page  mark,  and
                "inc2"  to be used after a page mark.  "inc1" and "inc2"
                are optional.



CX
Purpose:        Establish the second file of a co-edit  pair  or  switch
                between the files of a co-edit pair.

Syntax: CX:file

                     Suspend edit on current file and enter co-edit mode
                on  the  file  given  by  "file".   Type  any of the "E"
                commands to the second file of a co-edit pair to  return
                to normal edit mode.
        CX:file/R
                Same as CX:file, but file is opened for readonly.
        CX
                Toggle between the two co-edit files.



D
Purpose:        Remove lines from a file.

Syntax: D range

                     Delete the line or lines specified by "range".
        D range,Y
                Delete the lines specified by "range" without asking for
                confirmation  on  page deletion.  The ",Y" is assumed if
                EXPERT mode is in effect.



E/NEWCOMMAND
Purpose:        Exit the editor either with or without saving  the  edit
                and optionally start editing another file.

Syntax: E

                     Exit and update file.
        E:file
                Same as "E", but the updated file is written to  "file".
                If  ":file"  is  used,  it  must be the last item in the
                list.
        ER:file
                Same as "E", but begin SOSing "file" when done.  If "ER"
                is used, all strings for the last "F" and/or "S" command
                are retained,  as  are  most  other  attributes  of  the
                current  edit.  If "R:file" is used, it must be the last
                option in the list.  /R may  be  suffixed  to  the  file
                specification to open the file in readonly mode.

        The following 4 mutually exclusive characters may be suffixed to
        "E" prior to the ":" or "R:" options if either is used.

        C       Exit contiguous, unsequencing the file, and removing all
                page marks.
        S       Leave sequence numbers on the file.
        U       Unsequence the file.
        X       Leave the sequencing format the same as the input file.

        The following 3 mutually exclusive characters may be suffixed to
        any of "C", "S", "U", "X", or, if none of these options is used,
        to "E".

        B       Create a backup file.
        N       Create no backup files.
        O       Create .BAK and .OLD files.

        The following 2 options may be suffixed to any preceding  option
        in any order.

        D       If the input file is in readonly mode  or  is  different
                from  the  output file, delete it.  If the file is write
                protected, the "D" option is ignored.  If  /NODELETE  is
                in effect, SOS will ask for verification before deleting
                the file.
        Q       Quit.  All edits done since the last "[Saving]"  or  "W"
                command are lost.

                in effect, SOS will ask for verification before deleting
                the file.
        Q       Quit.  All edits done since the last "[Saving]"  or  "W"
                command are lost.



F/NEWCOMMAND
Purpose:        Locate a string of text within the file and print number
                of  the  line containing the string, optionally followed
                by the line itself.  In addition, the  "F"  command  can
                place  the user in alter mode on the line containing the
                string.

Syntax: F

                Find the first "n"  occurrences  of  "<string>"  on  the
                specified  range  as defined by the search criterion "x"
                and "E".
        F$range,x,E,n
                Same as above, but  searches  for  whatever  string  was
                given in the last "F" command.

        The following search or action criterion "x" may be one or  more
        of the following:

        A       Enter alter mode on  the  found  line,  positioning  the
                cursor before string that was found.
        D       Delete the found line.
        E       Require exact case match on the search strings (see also
                /EXACT).
        L       Print the line number of the found line only.
        M       Place a page mark before the found line.
        N       Find not.  Find  the  lines  that  do  not  contain  the
                specified strings.
        S       Do not print the found line.
        T       Give a total of the lines found.
        U       Print the line without line numbers.



F/OLDCOMMAND
Purpose:        Locate a string of text within the file and print number
                of  the  line containing the string, optionally followed
                by the line itself.  In addition, the  "F"  command  can
                place  the user in alter mode on the line containing the
                string.

Syntax: F

                     Find whatever string was last  searched  for,  with
                the  search  starting  at the line following the current
                one.
        F<string>$

                and "E".
        F$range,x,E,n
                Same as above, but  searches  for  whatever  string  was
                given in the last "F" command.

        The following search or action criterion "x" may be one or  more
        of the following:

                the  cursor  at  the end of the line and entering insert
                mode.  If ",S" is omitted, the entire  line  is  printed
                and  the cursor is left at the end of the line.  If ",S"
                is used, printing of the line is suppressed.  Note  that
                the  range  specification  may  be suffixed with ";m" to
                specify a temporary line increment to be used to  number
                new  lines created in this eXtend operation.  If <CR> is
                typed while in eXtend mode, a  new  line  will  will  be
                started  if  use of the global line increment allow room
                for such a line and /XINSERT  is  on.   If  no  room  is
                available  a  <CR> returns you to SOS command mode.  You
                may  exit  eXtend  mode  by  typing  ALTmode  or  ESCape

Syntax: @ filespec
                Execute the contents of the  file  given  by  "filespec"
                just as though whatever is in the file had been typed at
                the terminal.  Note  that  if  no  device  is  given  in
                "filespec",  devices  DSK:, TED:, and SYS:  are tried in
                that order in an effort to find the file.   If  no  file
                extension  is  given in "filespec", the extensions .CCL,
                .CMD, and the null extension are tried in that order  on
                each device.

                the  C128  representation of some of these special match
                characters has been removed.  It is hoped that these are
                more  consistent  and  easily  remembered.  They are all
                entered as a  control-E  followed  by  a  character,  as
                described below:

/
Purpose:        Allow setting of switches when in SOS command mode.

Syntax: /variable
                Define an SOS option as indicated by "variable" (e.g.,
                /AEXACT).
        /variable=value
                This switch causes SOS to set  "variable"  to  "value"
                (e.g., /FILL=1).
        /variable:value
                This syntax is equivalent to /variable=value.

                Help for a specific switch may be had by typing H/xxx,
                where  "xxx"
                is the switch name.  A highly abbreviated list of

/AEXACT
Purpose:        Allow specification of exact case match  on  alter  mode
                search strings.

Syntax: /AEXACT
                Require exact case match on alter mode search strings.
        /NOAEXACT
                Do not require exact case match  on  alter  mode  search
                strings.



/ALTER
Purpose:        Allow alter mode to be entered from Insert mode.

Syntax: /ALTER
                Enter alter mode if ALTmode or ESCape is typed while  in
                Insert  mode.   If  this switch is used, the only way to
                terminate insert mode is to type ALTmode  or  ESCape  in
                response to a line number.
        /NOALTER
                This switch disables both /DPYALT and /ALTER.



/BACKSPACE
Purpose:        Allow Control-H to be a substitute RUBout.

Syntax: /BACKSPACE
                Make ^H (Control-H or Backspace) equivalent  to  RUBout.
                If  this  switch  is enabled, ^H may still be entered in
                the text via the O sub-command in alter mode.
        /NOBACKSPACE
                Make  ^H  (Control-H  or  Backspace)  an  ordinary  text
                character.



/BAK
Purpose:        Allow SOS to create a backup file.

Syntax: /BAK
                Create a backup  (.BAK)  file  whenever  a  [Saving],  W
                command, or E command is used.  Refer to /OLD and /QZBAK
                for additional information.
        /NOBAK
                This  switch  disables  /BAK,  /OLD,  and  /QZBAK,  thus
                preventing creation of any backup files by SOS.



/BASIC
Purpose:        Allow SOS to process BASIC format files.

Syntax: /BASIC
                Allow BASIC format  pseudo-line  numbers  on  the  input
                file.   This  switch  may  be  selected  only on the SOS
                command line or via a SWITCH.INI file.



/BIGPG
Purpose:        To list the number of pages in the file.

Syntax: =BIGPG
                The largest page number in the file is printed out.



/BAUD
Purpose:        To select a minimum baud rate  at  which  display  alter
                mode  will  update  the  line  in  place  on  a  display
                terminal.

Syntax: /BAUD:n
                Select baud rate "n" as the minimum baud rate  at  which
                display  alter  mode  will update the line in place on a
                display terminal.



/BUFFER
Purpose:        Allow increased I/O buffer space.

Syntax: /BUFFER
                Increase I/O buffer space allocation for better  editing
                speed  on large files.  This switch may be selected only
                on the SOS command line or via a SWITCH.INI file.
        /NOBUFFER
                Do not use extra large editing buffers.  This switch may
                be  selected  only  on  the  SOS  command  line or via a
                SWITCH.INI file.



/CASE
Purpose:        To tell what display/edit mode is in effect.

Syntax: =CASE
                This will tell what display/edit mode is in effect.



/CCEXIT
Purpose:        Allow you to turn off SOS's Control-C trap.

Syntax: /CCEXIT
                Allow SOS to exit to  monitor  mode  when  Control-C  is
                typed.
        /NOCCEXIT
                Make SOS intercept Control-C's, and allow the  user  the
                options  of  continuing the edit, or exiting to monitor.
                If /NOCCEXIT is set, any one of  the  following  typeins
                may be used followed by a carriage return when SOS types
                "YES?  " in response to a Control-C.

                H - to type the following list of legal responses.
                C - to CONTINue the edit automatically.
                M - to return to MONITOR immediately.
                R - to REENTEr SOS, terminating an F or S command.
                E - to END the edit normally
                Q - to abort (QUIT) the edit and delete scratch files.



/CCL
Purpose:        Allow SOS to remember attributes across edits.

Syntax: /CCL
                Remember attributes across edits  in  a  given  terminal
                session.   This  is  done  via  a  temporary  file named
                "nnnESF.TMP", where "nnn" is  the  current  job  number.
                These  files  should be deleted at the end of a terminal
                session to prevent them from accumulating  over  several
                sessions.
        /NOCCL
                Do  not  retain  attributes  across  edits  in  a  given
                terminal session.



/CONTIGUOUS
Purpose:        Force unsequencing and page  mark  removal  of  the  SOS
                output file.

Syntax: /CONTIGUOUS
                This switch  results  in  SOS  writting  an  unsequenced
                output  file  free  of page page marks in response to an
                "E", "G", or "W" command that does not specify "S", "U",
                or "X".



/CRLF
Purpose:        Allow automatic insertion of Carriage Returns in a file.

Syntax: /CRLF:n
                Make SOS insert a Carriage Return in the file  replacing
                the  first  blank  space  typed  in  or  after character
                position "n".   A  value  of  0  for  "n"  disables  the
                automatic  insertion of Carriage Returns.  Note that the
                value of "n" includes the eight characters of  the  line
                number if /NUMBER has been selected.

        /NOCRLF
                This  switch,  like  /CRLF:0,  deselects  the  automatic
                insertion of Carriage Returns.



/C64
Purpose:        Allow selection of normal character input mode.

Syntax: /C64
                Select normal character  input  mode.   This  makes  the
                apostrophe  an  ordinary  input  character  instead of a
                special flag for control characters.  This switch is the
                inverse of /C128.



/C128
Purpose:        Allow selection of special quoted-character input mode.

Syntax: /C128
                Select special quoted-character input mode.  This  makes
                the  apostrophe  a  special  character used for entering
                control characters according  to  the  following  table.
                Lower  case  text may be entered by typing an apostrophe
                before each lower case character.  This  switch  is  the
                inverse of /C64 and is useful only when the terminal you
                are using has no control characters on the keyboard.

/C128 Special Character Mapping Table.

/DECIDE
Purpose:        Enable Auto-decide mode on S(ubstitute) commands.

Syntax: /DECIDE
                When /DECIDE is used, SOS will  print  each  line  after
                making  the  requested substitution, and wait for you to
                type  Carriage  Return  or   <space>   to   accept   the
                substitution, RUBout to reject the substitution, or A to
                enter alter mode on this line.  If you enter alter mode,
                type  a  carriage  return  to  continue  the  substitute
                command.

        /NODECIDE
                Do not pause after making each substitution.



/DECRYPT
Purpose:        Allow specification of a decryption password.

Syntax: /DECRYPT
                This switch tells SOS to ask for a  decryption  password
                at  the  start  of  the  edit.  The password will not be
                echoed at your terminal when you type it in.   If  there
                is  no  password,  simply  type Carriage Return when SOS
                asks for the password.  The decryption  password  allows
                you  to  read  a file that has been previously encrypted
                with SOS.  If you give the wrong  password,  or  try  to
                look  at the file with something other than SOS, it will
                appear to be garbage.  Exiting by any other  means  than
                EQ  after  having given an incorrect password may result
                in the destruction of your file.  /DECRYPT is only valid
                on the SOS command line or in a SWITCH.INI file.



/DEFINE
Purpose:        To define a macro name

Syntax: /DEFINE:name:string
                DEFINE the macro called "name" to be the text  "string".
                "String"  itself  may contain other macros, which may be
                expanded at definition time (if  expressed  with  single
                angle  brackets  <xxx>),  or expanded it invocation time
                (if expressed with double angle brackets <<xxx>>).   See
                also /LDEFINE, /MACRO, /PURGE for related information.
        /DEFINE:name:"string1
                      string2"
                Like /DEFINE, except the  macro  definition  is  several
                lines long.



/DELETE
Purpose:        Allow SOS to delete the input  file  when  ED  is  typed
                without asking for verification.

Syntax: /DELETE
                If ED is typed and the input file is in readonly mode or
                is  different  from the output file, SOS will delete the
                input file without asking for verification.  If the file
                is  write  protected,  the ED request is treated as an E
                request.
        /NODELETE
                Require SOS to ask for verification when  ED  is  typed.
                You  may  respond  with  either "Y" or "N" followed by a
                Carriage Return.  If "Y" is entered,  SOS  will  proceed
                just  as  though  /DELETE  had  been present.  If "N" is
                typed, the ED request is treated as an E request.



/DISK
Purpose:        List disk quotas for your current job and PPN.

Syntax: =DISK
                The current disk quotas for your job and PPN, as well as
                the total space available to the system are listed.



/DISPLAY
Purpose:        To allow optimum display handling for a given terminal.

Syntax: /DISPLAY
                This switch enables SOS to do optimum  display  handling
                for  the  given terminal type as set to the monitor with
                the TERMINAL TYPE xxxx command.

                It will enable the following, depending on the  type  of
                terminal:

                Special handling of <rub>, ^U, ^R, ^W.

                Backspace up a line when print commands are given.

                Allow continuous update of a line in  alter  mode  which
                causes  SOS to continually update the line being altered
                so that its current state is  always  displayed  on  the
                terminal  screen.   Please  note that this switch is not
                useful at transmission  rates  of  less  than  600  baud
                because  of  the time required to update the entire line
                after a character is inserted or deleted from the middle
                of  the  line.   Refer  to  /DPY,  /DPYALT,  and /LF for
                additional display features.

        /NODISPLAY
                Disable the display features.



/DPY
Purpose:        Enable CRT display mode for editing.

Syntax: /DPY
                This switch causes SOS to process RUBouts,  ^R,  and  ^U
                itself.   When  a  RUBout is entered, SOS will erase the
                deleted characters from the  screen.   This  feature  is
                especially  useful  in  alter  mode  when backing up the
                cursor, as the cursor will simply move across  the  line
                without  echoing  characters.   When  ^R  is  typed, SOS
                retypes the line up  to  the  current  cursor  position.
                When  ^U  is  typed,  SOS  reprints the line number, but
                forgets the rest of the line.   Refer  to  /C64,  /C128,
                /M33, /M37, /LOWER, /STANDARD, and /UPPER for additional
                information.



/DPYALT
Purpose:        Position the cursor at end-of-line and enter alter  mode
                from Insert mode when a ALTmode or ESCape is typed.

Syntax: /DPYALT
                If /ALTER is used, but /DPYALT is not,  SOS  will  enter
                alter  mode  after  prompting  you with the current line
                number.  With /DPYALT enabled, SOS will enter alter mode
                at  the  end  of the current line.  /DPYALT also selects
                /ALTER.  /DPYALT is  intended  primarily  for  use  with
                /DPY, but functions with /STANDARD also.



/DSK
Purpose:        List disk quotas for your current job and PPN.

Syntax: =DSK
                The current disk quotas for your job and PPN, as well as
                the total space available to the system are listed.



/ENCRYPT
Purpose:        Allow specification of a encryption password.

Syntax: /ENCRYPT
                This switch tells SOS to ask for an encryption  password
                for  the input file and for the output file at the start
                of the edit.  The password will not be  echoed  at  your
                terminal  when  you type it in.  If there is no password
                for  a  file,  simply  type  Carriage  Return  when  SOS
                requests  the  password  for that file.  Encryption of a
                file means that someone who does not know  the  password
                cannot  interpret  the  data  in the file.  Thus, if you
                give the wrong the password for the file, or try to look
                at  it  with  anything  but  SOS,  it  will appear to be
                garbage.  Exiting by  any  other  means  than  EQ  after
                having  given  an  incorrect  password may result in the
                destruction of your file.  /ENCRYPT is only valid on the
                SOS command line or in a SWITCH.INI file.



/ERROR
Purpose:        To list the long form on the last error message.

Syntax: =ERROR
                The long form of the  last  error  message  is  printed.
                This  is  useful  if  /EXPERT  is  in effect, as /EXPERT
                outputs the short form of an error message.



/EXACT
Purpose:        Require exact case match in search strings on F(ind) and
                S(ubstitute) commands.

Syntax: /EXACT
                Require exact case match in search strings on  F  and  S
                commands.
        /NOEXACT
                Do not require exact case match in search strings  on  F
                and S commands.



/EXPERT
Purpose:        This command tells SOS that you are an experienced user.

Syntax: /EXPERT
                This command causes SOS to use 3 character abbreviations
                for  error  messages,  with the full text of the message
                available for your inspection by typing  "=ERROR".   SOS
                will  not  ask  for  verification  when  a  D(elete)  or
                R(eplace) that would remove an entire page is attempted.
                In  addition,  SOS will allow the D and R commands to be
                used without a period (e.g., "D" becomes  an  acceptable
                substitute   for  "D.").   /EXPERT  is  the  inverse  of
                /NOVICE.
        /NOEXPERT
                This command, which is equivalent to /NOVICE, causes SOS
                to use full length error messages instead of 3 character
                abbreviations.  SOS will ask  for  verification  when  a
                D(elete)  or  R(eplace) that would remove an entire page
                is attempted.  In addition, SOS will not allow the D and
                R commands to be used without a period (e.g., "D" is not
                an acceptable substitute for "D.").



/FILE
Purpose:        Define the output file name for the current edit.

Syntax: /FILE:file spec.
                This option causes SOS to write the output of  the  edit
                to "file spec.", instead of updating the original file.



/FILLCLASS
Purpose:        Set the fill class for the terminal in the  same  manner
                as the monitor command

                .SET TTY FILL n

Syntax: /FILLCLASS:n
                Set the fill class for the terminal to "n".  "n" may  be
                0,  1, 2, or 3.  Note that /FILLCLASS:0 is equivalent to
                the monitor command

                .SET TTY NO FILL
        /NOFILL
                Set the fill class for the terminal to  0.   /NOFILL  is
                equivalent to /FILLCLASS:0 and to the monitor command

                .SET TTY NO FILL



/INCREMENT
Purpose:        Establish an initial value for the default  global  line
                increment.

Syntax: /INCREMENT:n
                Set the default global line  increment  to  "n"  at  the
                start of each edit.



/INFORM
Purpose:        List line numbers of first and last lines  (D)eleted  or
                (R)eplaced.

Syntax: /INFORM
                This switch tells SOS to type out how  many  lines  were
                deleted  by  a  D  or R command, as well as the range of
                those lines.
        /NOINFORM
                This switch tells SOS not to type out the numbers of the
                lines affected by a D or R command.



/INITIALIZE
Purpose:        To automatically perform setup  functions  when  SOS  is
                started.

Syntax: /INITIALIZE
                The file SOS.INI is invoked as though it was an indirect
                command  file,  and  the  actions are taken accordingly.
                This happens whenever SOS is first started.



/INSERT
Purpose:        Cause SOS to prompt you with the  first  available  line
                number when creating a new file.

Syntax: /INSERT
                This switch tells SOS to  automatically  enter  I(nsert)
                mode when creating a new file.
        /NOINSERT
                This switch causes SOS to prompt you  with  an  asterisk
                when creating a new file instead of prompting you with a
                line number.



/ISAVE
Purpose:        Make SOS automatically save the state of the file  after
                a selected number of lines is added.

Syntax: /ISAVE:n
                Make SOS automatically save the state of the file if "n"
                lines  have  been  inserted since the last time the file
                was saved.   This  feature  can  minimize  the  loss  of
                entered data in the event of an interruption of computer
                service.    Refer   to   /SAVE   for   additional   file
                preservation capabilities.



/LC
Purpose:        Enable entry of lower case text.

Syntax: /LC
                Allow letters not specifically typed as upper case  text
                to  be interpreted as lower case text in the same manner
                as the monitor commands

                .SET TTY LC or .SET TTY NO UC
        /NOLC
                This command causes all text to be interpreted as  upper
                case text in the same manner as the monitor commands

                .SET TTY NO LC or .SET TTY UC



/LDEFINE
Purpose:        To define a macro name as a range specification.

Syntax: /LDEFINE:name:range
                Define the macro "name" to be the resolved text form  of
                the  "range".   Any  single  line  specifier  or a range
                specifier   is   legal.    All   special   symbols   and
                addition/subtraction  will  be  resolved  at  definition
                time.   For  example,  /LDEFINE:XX:200/.+1:*-5/10  might
                define   XX  as  00200/6:05500/10.   See  also  /DEFINE,
                /MACRO, and /PURGE for related information.



/LENGTH
Purpose:        Define the number of lines per physical page of paper.

Syntax: /LENGTH:n
                Set the number of lines that should be  printed  between
                SOS  generated  page ejects when the "P" command is used
                to "n".  This command is most useful when  doing  output
                on hard copy devices directly from SOS.



/LF
Purpose:        Eliminate stray blank lines  between  printed  lines  on
                display terminals.

Syntax: /LF
                This switch allows SOS to eliminate  stray  blank  lines
                that  may  occur  on  a  display  terminal  when the "P"
                command or the Line Feed key is used to type a  file  on
                your terminal.
        /NOLF
                This switch disables the above feature.



/LMAR
Purpose:        Set the left margin for SOS text justification.

Syntax: /LMAR:n
                This switch sets the left margin for text  justification
                to  character  position  "n".   The  left most character
                position in any line is considered to be position 1.



/LOCATION
Purpose:        To list the first line/page in the editing buffer.

Syntax: =LOCATION
                The first line/page number  in  the  editing  buffer  is
                listed.   Note  the  current line/page may be found with
                the command "=."



/LOWER
Purpose:        Make lower case the default input  mode  for  characters
                typed on a Model 33 Teletype.

Syntax: /LOWER
                This switch makes all letters entered into a file be  in
                lower   case   unless  the  letter  is  preceded  by  an
                apostrophe.  When /LOWER is set, upper  case  characters
                in  a  line  printed  by  SOS  will  be  preceded  by an
                apostrophe.  Refer to /C64,  /C128,  /DPY,  /M33,  /M37,
                /STANDARD, and /UPPER for additional information.



/MACRO
Purpose:        To enable a macro facility.

Syntax: /MACRO
                Allow macros to be expanded.  A macro is  expanded  into
                text, and the text used in place.  It can be used in any
                context, and can be some, all, or multiple commands,  or
                used  in  insert  mode.   When  /MACRO is enabled, angle
                brackets (< and >) are treated specially, and  are  used
                to delimit macro names.  See also /DEFINE, /LDEFINE, and
                /PURGE for related information.
        <name>
                Expand the macro "name".
        <name,n>
                Expand the macro "name" n times.
        <name,*>
                Expand  the  macro  "name"  until  a  command  error  is
                generated.
        <name(arg,arg)>
                Expand the macro "name" with arguments "arg".



/MAXLN
Purpose:        Define the largest  line  number  to  allow  on  an  SOS
                "page".

Syntax: /MAXLN:n
                Set the largest line number allowed on any SOS  page  to
                "n".    If,  when  doing  an  operation  other  than  an
                insertion, the next line number would  exceed  "n",  SOS
                will  automatically  insert  a page mark in the file and
                restart the sequencing.



/M33
Purpose:        Inform SOS that you are using a Model 33 Teletype.

Syntax: /M33
                When  /M33  is  used,   SOS   will   provide   character
                translation  for  left  and  right  curly braces and the
                garroted bar.  Control  characters  will  be  translated
                according to the table given with /C128.  Since Model 33
                Teletypes  do  not  have  lower  case,  all  lower  case
                characters  are  preceded  by  an  apostrophe.  Refer to
                /C64, /C128, /DPY, /LOWER, /M37, /STANDARD,  and  /UPPER
                for additional information.



/M37
Purpose:        Inform SOS that you are using a Model 37 Teletype.

Syntax: /M37
                When /M37  is  used,  SOS  will  not  provide  character
                translation  for  left  and  right  curly braces and the
                garroted  bar,  as  a  Model  37  terminal   has   these
                characters.    Control  characters  will  be  translated
                according to the table given with /C128.  Since Model 37
                Teletypes have lower case, all lower case characters are
                printed as is.  Refer  to  /C64,  /C128,  /DPY,  /LOWER,
                /M33, /STANDARD, and /UPPER for additional information.



/NAME
Purpose:        Define the output file name for the current edit.

Syntax: /NAME:file spec.
                This option causes SOS to write the output of  the  edit
                to "file spec.", instead of updating the original file.



/NEWALTER 
Purpose:        Allow the use of the new alter command set.

Syntax: /NEWALTER
                This allows the use of a  new  alter  command  set  with
                extended features and more mnomnic commands.
        /OLDALTER
                The old alter command set is enabled again.



/NEWCOMMAND
Purpose:        To select a new command set.

Syntax: /NEWCOMMAND
                This  selects  a  new  set  of   commands.    For   more
                information, see /OLDCOMMANDS for a list of changes.



/NOVICE
Purpose:        This switch tells SOS that you are not an expert user.

Syntax: /NOVICE
                This command, which is equivalent to  /NOEXPERT,  causes
                SOS  to  use  full  length  error  messages instead of 3
                character abbreviations.  SOS will ask for  verification
                when a D(elete) or R(eplace) that would remove an entire
                page is attempted.  In addition, SOS will not allow  the
                D  and R commands to be used without a period (e.g., "D"
                is not an acceptable substitute for "D.").   /NOVICE  is
                the inverse of /EXPERT.



/NUMBER
Purpose:        Print the line numbers at your terminal when editing.

Syntax: /NUMBER
                This  switch  causes  SOS  to  type  the   line   number
                associated with a line whenever it must type the line.

        /NONUMBER
                This switch prevents SOS from  typing  the  line  number
                associated with a line whenever a line must be typed.



/OLD
Purpose:        Allow two levels of backup files.

Syntax: /OLD
                If /OLD is used, SOS will create a file of the same name
                as  the  one  you  are  editing,  but with the extension
                changed to .OLD provided such a file  does  not  already
                exist.   If  a  .OLD  file does exist, SOS will create a
                .BAK  file  instead.   Refer  to  /BAK  and  /QZBAK  for
                additional information.

        /NOBAK
                This  switch  disables  /BAK,  /OLD,  and  /QZBAK,  thus
                preventing creation of any backup files by SOS.



/OLDALTER
Purpose:        Allow the use of the old format command set.

Syntax: /OLDALTER
                The old alter command set is enabled again.
        /NEWALTER
                This allows the use of a  new  alter  command  set  with
                extended features and more mnonmic commands.



/OLDCOMMAND
Purpose:        To select  an  old  command  set,  compatible  with  SOS
                version 21.

Syntax: /OLDCOMMAND
                This makes commands that may  have  changed,  compatible
                with  SOS  version  21/23 as much as possible, sometimes
                sacrificing   new   features    or    cleaner    command
                implementations.  This has the following effects:

                /QZBAK is the default.  This  writes  *.Q??   and  *.Z??
                backup files.

                /EXPERT defaults /NOINFORM, /NOVICE defaults /INFORM.

                Exit options S  and  B  mean  unsequence  and  nobackup,
                respectively.

                N  is  treated  like  NF  (renumber  file)  instead   of
                renumbering the current page only.

                The default STEP and START are 100, and not 10.

                In alter mode, V means invert  case  of  word,  #  means
                invert  case to the end of the line, X means replace the
                current word, and T means to extend the line.

        /NEWCOMMAND
                Disables  /OLDCOMMAND,  and   the   associated   changed
                commands.



/OPTION
Purpose:        Select special editing options from SWITCH.INI.

Syntax: /OPTIONS:name
                This switch causes SOS to process the line in SWITCH.INI
                beginning  with  "SOS:name/switches"  in addition to the
                line beginning with "SOS/switches".



/PLINES
Purpose:        Define the default number of lines to print in  response
                to a "P" command that does not specify a line range.

Syntax: /PLINES:n
                Set the number of lines to print for a "P" command  that
                does  not  specify  a  line range to "n".  A "P" command
                with no  line  range  will  also  terminate  at  a  page
                boundary.



/PMAR
Purpose:        Set the paragraph margin for SOS text justification.

Syntax: /PMAR:n
                This switch sets the indentation for the first line of a
                paragraph  to  character  position  "n".   The left most
                character position in  any  line  is  considered  to  be
                position 1.



/PROGRAM
Purpose:        Disable entry of lower case text.

Syntax: /PROGRAM
                This command causes all text to be interpreted as  upper
                case text in the same manner as the monitor commands

                .SET TTY NO LC or .SET TTY UC



/PROTECT
Purpose:        To set the file protection for the output file from SOS.

Syntax: /PROTECT:nnn
                This switch sets the file protection for the file to  be
                written by SOS to "nnn".



/PURGE
Purpose:        To purge all currently defined macros.

Syntax: /PURGE
                All currently defined  macros  are  deleted.   See  also
                /DEFINE, /LDEFINE, and /MACRO for related information.



/QZBAK
Purpose:        Allow two levels of backup files in a manner similar  to
                DEC release SOS.

Syntax: /QZBAK
                When this switch is selected,  the  .BAK  file  will  be
                given  the  extension  of the form .Qxx, where xx is the
                last  two  letters  in  the  original  extension.    For
                example,  if the original extension was .MAC, the backup
                file with /QZBAK selected would become .QAC.  Also,  the
                .OLD  file  will  be given an extension of .Zxx.  Use of
                this switch allows a user  to  keep  backup  files  from
                files  of  the  same  name but with different extensions
                simultaneously.  Refer to /OLD and /BAK  for  additional
                information.

        /NOBAK
                This  switch  disables  /BAK,  /OLD,  and  /QZBAK,  thus
                preventing creation of any backup files by SOS.

        /NOQZBAK
                This switch disables /QZBAK without  affecting  /BAK  or
                /OLD.



/R
Purpose:        Look at a file in Readonly mode.

Syntax: /R
                This switch allows you to look at a  file  in  a  manner
                that  prevents  alterations  to  the  file.  Use of this
                switch saves most of the overhead of  scanning  a  file,
                and  this  in turn speeds up the scanning process.  Note
                that if "ED" is used to exit a  file  for  which  /R  is
                selected,  SOS  will  attempt  to  delete  the  file  as
                described under /DELETE.  /R can only be turned  off  by
                exiting SOS.  Refer to /X for additional information.



/READONLY
Purpose:        Look at a file in Readonly mode.

Syntax: /READONLY
                This switch allows you to look at a  file  in  a  manner
                that  prevents  alterations  to  the  file.  Use of this
                switch saves most of the overhead of  scanning  a  file,
                and  this  in turn speeds up the scanning process.  Note
                that if "ED" is used to exit a file for which  /READONLY
                is  selected,  SOS  will  attempt  to delete the file as
                described under /DELETE.  /READONLY can only  be  turned
                off   by  exiting  SOS.   Refer  to  /X  for  additional
                information.



/REFDLY
Purpose:        Establish a delay time for screen refreshes.

Syntax: /REFDLY:n
                This switch allows you to establish a minimum delay time
                before   the   screen  is  refreshed  when  /DISPLAY  is
                selected.  Normally, SOS will  refresh  the  line  after
                each  character  is  entered.  If /REFDLY:n is selected,
                SOS will refresh the line only if "n" milliseconds  have
                elapsed  since  the  last  character was typed in.  This
                reduces the number  of  characters  transmitted  to  the
                terminal,  while  still  maintaining  the convenience of
                continuous updates.



/RONLY
Purpose:        Look at a file in RONLY mode.

Syntax: /RONLY
                This switch allows you to look at a  file  in  a  manner
                that  prevents  alterations  to  the  file.  Use of this
                switch saves most of the overhead of  scanning  a  file,
                and  this  in turn speeds up the scanning process.  Note
                that if "ED" is used to exit a file for which /RONLY  is
                selected,  SOS  will  attempt  to  delete  the  file  as
                described under /DELETE.  /RONLY can only be turned  off
                by exiting SOS.  Refer to /X for additional information.



/RMAR
Purpose:        Set the right margin for SOS text justification.

Syntax: /RMAR:n
                This switch sets the right margin for text justification
                to  character  position  "n".   The  left most character
                position in any line is considered to be position 1.



/RULER
Purpose:        Provide a ruler for aligns columns.

                Syntax:  =RULER A ruler labeling  the  columns  will  be
                typed out.  It is of the form:  123456789 123456789 ....
                to terminal width



/RUN
Purpose:        This switch allows setting the name of the program to be
                run in response to a "G" command.

Syntax: /RUN:file spec
                This will cause the program given by "file spec"  to  be
                run  when SOS is exited with a "G" command.  The default
                program is  "SYS:COMPIL",  which  will  cause  the  last
                EXECUTE, LOAD, etc., command to be repeated.



/SAVE
Purpose:        Make SOS automatically save the state of the file  after
                a selected number of modifications is made.

Syntax: /SAVE:n
                Make SOS automatically save the state of the file if "n"
                lines  have  been  modified since the last time the file
                was saved.   This  feature  can  minimize  the  loss  of
                entered data in the event of an interruption of computer
                service.   Refer   to   /ISAVE   for   additional   file
                preservation capabilities.



/SEPARATOR
Purpose:        Allow "%", "$", and "." to be treated as  delimiters  in
                F(ind) and S(ubstitute) commands.

Syntax: /SEPARATOR
                This switch causes "%", "$", and "." to  be  treated  as
                separators in F and S commands.  A separator is normally
                defined as any character which is not a letter,  number,
                "$", "%", or ".".

        /NOSEPARATOR
                This switch restores the default condition  of  treating
                "$",  "%",  and  "."  in  the same manner as letters and
                digits in F and S commands.



/SEQUENCE
Purpose:        Force sequence numbering of the SOS output file.

Syntax: /SEQUENCE
                This switch results in SOS writing a  sequence  numbered
                output  file  in response to an "E", "G", or "W" command
                that does not specify "S", "U", or "X".
        /NOSEQUENCE
                This switch, which is equivalent to /UNSEQUENCE, results
                in  SOS  writing  an  unsequence numbered output file in
                response to an "E", "G", or "W" command  that  does  not
                specify "S", "U", or "X".



/STANDARD
Purpose:        Inform SOS that you are using a standard terminal.

Syntax: /STANDARD
                This switch informs SOS that  the  terminal  in  use  is
                neither  a  CRT nor a Model 33 or 37 Teletype.  SOS will
                process ^R, ^U, and RUBout itself.  When  ^R  is  typed,
                the  entire  line,  including  the  line number, will be
                retyped up to the  current  cursor  position.   ^U  will
                cause the line number to be retyped, but the rest of the
                line  will  be  forgotten.   RUBout   will   cause   the
                characters  passed  over  to be echoed, but they will be
                separated from the rest  of  the  line  by  backslashes.
                Lower   case   text,  special  characters,  and  control
                characters are  entered  into  the  file  by  using  the
                terminal  keyboard,  rather than by depending on SOS for
                character translations.  Refer  to  /C64,  /C128,  /DPY,
                /LOWER,   /M33,   /M37,   and   /UPPER   for  additional
                information.



/START
Purpose:        Define the default starting value to use for  the  first
                line  number on each page when reading in an unsequenced
                file.

Syntax: /START:n
                Set the default value for the first line number on  each
                page  of an unsequenced file to "n".  This switch may be
                selected  only  on  the  SOS  command  line  or  via   a
                SWITCH.INI file.



/STEP
Purpose:        Define the default line increment to use  for  numbering
                each line on a given page when reading in an unsequenced
                file.

Syntax: /STEP:n
                Set the default value for the line increment on a  given
                page  of an unsequenced file to "n".  This switch may be
                selected  only  on  the  SOS  command  line  or  via   a
                SWITCH.INI file.



/STRING
Purpose:        To list the current strings used in the last F(ind)  and
                S(ubstitute) command.
Syntax: =STRING
                The strings used in the  last  F(ind)  and  S(ubstitute)
                command are listed.  If no strings are given in a F or S
                command, these strings will be used again.



/TELL
Purpose:        To inform the user what file name SOS used for output.

Syntax: /TELL
                This switch will cause SOS to type out the name  of  its
                output file after a "E", "G", or "W" command is used.
        /NOTELL
                This switch will prevent SOS from typing out the name of
                its  output  file  after  an "E", "G", or "W" command is
                used.



/TEXT
Purpose:        Enable entry of lower case text.

Syntax: /TEXT
                Allow letters not specifically typed as upper case  text
                to  be interpreted as lower case text in the same manner
                as the monitor commands

                .SET TTY LC or .SET TTY NO UC



/UC
Purpose:        Disable entry of lower case text.

Syntax: /UC
                This command causes all text to be interpreted as  upper
                case text in the same manner as the monitor commands

                .SET TTY NO LC or .SET TTY UC
        /NOUC
                Allow letters not specifically typed as upper case  text
                to  be interpreted as lower case text in the same manner
                as the monitor commands

                .SET TTY LC or .SET TTY NO UC



/UNSEQUENCE
Purpose:        Inhibit sequence numbering of the SOS output file.

Syntax: /UNSEQUENCE
                This switch, which is equivalent to /NOSEQUENCE, results
                in  SOS  writing  an  unsequence numbered output file in
                response to an "E", "G", or "W" command  that  does  not
                specify "S", "U", or "X".



/UPPER
Purpose:        Make upper case the default input  mode  for  characters
                typed on a Model 33 Teletype.

Syntax: /UPPER
                This switch makes all letters entered into a file be  in
                upper   case   unless  the  letter  is  preceded  by  an
                apostrophe.  When /UPPER is set, lower  case  characters
                in  a  line  printed  by  SOS  will  be  preceded  by an
                apostrophe.  Refer to /C64,  /C128,  /DPY,  /M33,  /M37,
                /STANDARD, and /LOWER for additional information.



/WIDTH Purpose:  /WIDTH allows setting of the terminal line width.

Syntax: /WIDTH:n
                This switch will set the  terminal  line  width  to  "n"
                characters.   "n" must lie between 16 and 200 inclusive.
                If more than "n" characters are typed  on  a  line,  the
                operating  system  will  break the line visually at your
                terminal and move the carriage to the beginning  of  the
                next  line.  The setting of this switch has no effect on
                the data entered in the file.  To have a Carriage Return
                automatically   inserted   in   the  file  at  specified
                intervals, see /CRLF.



/WINDOW
Purpose:        This switch allows you to change the  size  of  the  SOS
                edit window.

Syntax: /WINDOW:n
                "n" is the size of the in-core window to  the  file  and
                defaults  to about 1620 (decimal) words.  If "n" is less
                than or equal to 256, it is the  window  size  in  nK;if
                greater  than  256,  it  is  the  size in words.  Larger
                window sizes can speed up editing on  large  files,  but
                may  degrade  your response, as SOS will need more core.
                If the value of "n" is so  large  that  SOS  cannot  get
                enough  core  to  satisfy  it,  SOS will use the default
                window size.  See /WMAXIMUM, /WMINIMUM, and /WRATIO  for
                additional information.



/WMAXIMUM
Purpose:        This switch allows you to change the size of the largest
                possible edit window.

Syntax: /WMAXIMUM:n
                "n" is the size of the largest possible  in-core  window
                to the file and defaults to 12K (decimal) words.  If "n"
                is less than or equal to 256, it is the  maximum  window
                size in nK;if greater than 256, it is the size in words.
                SOS divides the file size by the value of  /WRATIO,  and
                then  uses  the  result  as  the  window  size.   If the
                computed size would be less than  the  /WMINIMUM  value,
                the  /WMINIMUM  is  used.   If  the  computed size would
                exceed /WMAXIMUM, the /WMAXIMUM value is used.   A  user
                specified  /WINDOW  value will override the SOS computed
                value.  Larger window sizes  can  speed  up  editing  on
                large  files, but may degrade your response, as SOS will
                need  more  core.   Refer  to  /WINDOW,  /WMINIMUM,  and
                /WRATIO for additional information.



/WMINIMUM
Purpose:        This switch  allows  you  to  change  the  size  of  the
                smallest possible edit window.

Syntax: /WMINIMUM:n
                "n" is the size of the smallest possible in-core  window
                to  the file and defaults to 1K (decimal) words.  If "n"
                is less than or equal to 256, it is the  minimum  window
                size in nK;if greater than 256, it is the size in words.
                SOS divides the file size by the value of  /WRATIO,  and
                then  uses  the  result  as  the  window  size.   If the
                computed size would be less than  the  /WMINIMUM  value,
                the  /WMINIMUM  is  used.   If  the  computed size would
                exceed /WMAXIMUM, the /WMAXIMUM value is used.   A  user
                specified  /WINDOW  value will override the SOS computed
                value.  Larger window sizes  can  speed  up  editing  on
                large  files, but may degrade your response, as SOS will
                need  more  core.   Refer  to  /WINDOW,  /WMAXIMUM,  and
                /WRATIO for additional information.



/WRATIO
Purpose:        This switch allows you to change the number SOS uses  to
                compute the initial window size from the file size.

Syntax: /WRATIO:n
                "n" is the number SOS will divide into the file size  to
                get  an  initial  estimate  for  a window size.  /WRATIO
                defaults to 4.  If the computed size would be less  than
                the  /WMINIMUM  value,  the  /WMINIMUM  is used.  If the
                computed size  would  exceed  /WMAXIMUM,  the  /WMAXIMUM
                value  is  used.   A  user  specified /WINDOW value will
                override the SOS computed value.   Larger  window  sizes
                can  speed  up  editing  on large files, but may degrade
                your response, as SOS will need more  core.   Values  of
                /WRATIO  in  excess  of  10  will  greatly  impair  your
                response.  Refer to /WINDOW,  /WMAXIMUM,  and  /WMINIMUM
                for additional information.



/X
Purpose:        Look at a file in eXamine mode.

Syntax: /X
                This switch allows you to look at a  file  in  a  manner
                that  prevents  alterations  to  the  file.  Use of this
                switch saves most of the overhead of  scanning  a  file,
                and  this  in turn speeds up the scanning process.  Note
                that if "ED" is used to exit a  file  for  which  /X  is
                selected,  SOS  will  attempt  to  delete  the  file  as
                described under /DELETE.  /X can only be turned  off  by
                exiting SOS.  If the file is unsequenced, /X is the same
                as /R plus /NONUMBER.  If the file is sequenced,  /X  is
                equivalent to /R.



/XINSERT
Purpose:        To control the inserting of new lines in eXtend mode.

Syntax: /XINSERT
                Allow new lines to be  inserted  if  <CR>  is  typed  in
                eXtend mode, and the global line increment allows such a
                line.
        /NOXINSERT
                Do not allow new lines to be inserted if a <CR> is typed
                in eXtend mode.



/XSEQUENCE
Purpose:        Write the SOS output file in the same sequencing  format
                as the SOS input file.

Syntax: /XSEQUENCE
                This  switch  results  in  SOS  writing  a  file   whose
                sequencing format is the same as that of the input file.
                If a file is being created, /XSEQUENCE is  the  same  as
                /UNSEQUENCE.   "S",  "U",  or "X" can be used on an "E",
                "G", or "W" command to override this switch setting.
