Throughout this file, the following terms apply.
.B;.LM 16
.I-16;Term	Meaning
.B
.I-16;n		a positive integer.
.I-16;+n		a positive integer.
.I-16;-n		a negative integer.
.I-16;range		is an SOS line range specification. It is made up of
a starting and an ending point separated by a colon.
A line number specification is given on each side of
the colon. There are several special elements that
may be used in line number specifications in place of
or in addition to an actual line number. These are:
.B;.LM 24
.I-8;_#	is the first line of the last line range
specification given.
.I-8;%	is the last line of the last insert command
given.
.I-8;_.	is the current line number if used to the left
of a slash, or the current page if used to the
right of a slash. This may be omitted on most
commands (except "R" and "D" in NOVICE mode).
Thus, "A.<CR>" and "A<CR>" are equivalent.
.I-8;_^	is the first line on the current page if used
to the left of a slash or the first page in
the current file if used to the right of a
slash.
.I-8;*	is the last line on the current page if used
to the left of a slash or the last page in the
current file if used to the right of a slash.
.I-8;!	may be suffixed to a line number or one of the
above characters and followed by a digit
giving the number of lines. Thus, ".!5" means
five lines starting at the current line.
.I-8;BF	is the beginning of file (same as _^/_^).
.I-8;EF	is the end of file (same as */*) when used as
the second argument to the range specifier, or
is the entire file (same as _^/_^:*/*) when used
as a range specifier by itself.
.B;.LM 16
Arithmetic expressions using plus and minus may also
be included in a line number specification. Thus,
".-5" means five lines before the current line, ".+4"
means 4 lines beyond the current line, and ".-2!4"
means start 2 lines before the current line and go for
4 lines.
.B
In addition, a line number specification may be
suffixed with a slash and a page number specification.
Page numbers can be constructed in a manner similar to
line numbers. As an example, "_^!5/47" means five
lines starting at the first line on page 47. If the
page specification is omitted, the current page is
assumed.
.B
Thus an example of a line range specification would be
"10/1:*/999", meaning line 10 on page 1 through the
last line on page 999.
.B
A search string specified between ALTmodes may be
specified in place of a line number specification.
Commands using this must be terminated with 1 <CR> to
end the search string, and 1 additional <CR> to end
the command instead of the usual 1 <CR>. Thus,
"$foo$<CR><CR>" means the next line containing the
string "foo".
.B
.I-16;$		is the symbol for the ESCape or ALTmode key. If this
character is typed in response to the SOS "*", the
line preceding the current line will be printed.
.B
.I-16;<CR>		is the symbol for the Carriage Return key.
.B
.I-16;<LF>		is the symbol for the Line Feed key. If <LF> is typed
in response to the SOS "*", the line following the
current line will be printed.
.B
.I-16;<STRING>	is used to represent a valid search string. A search
string consists of up to 20 character strings separated
by <CR> and terminated by an ALTmode. The search
string may contain certain special characters to
control the search. The S(ubstitute) command accepts
two such arguments - the first is the string to look
for, while the second is a string to replace the first
one. These special characters are preceeded by a
control-E (_^E). A detailed explanation of the
pattern match characters can be found under _^E.
.B
.I-16;_^_^		is also used as a flag in this file for the SOS "H,x"
command. _^_^ may be encountered if the monitor command
.B
_.HELP SOS
.B
is used. It is not part of the text and should be
ignored.
.PAGE
.I-16;_A/NEWALTER
.I-16;Purpose:	The "A" command causes SOS to enter intraline edit
mode. Once in this mode, any of the intraline edit
commands are valid. Unless otherwise noted, an
intraline edit command may be preceded by an integer
and/or a sign to modify its function. In general, a
positive integer preceding a command means "the next
<integer> occurrences", and a negative integer means
"the previous <integer> occurrences". If no integer
precedes a command, 1 is assumed. At all times, the
cursor is positioned between 2 characters or between a
character and one end of the line. The cursor will be
visually positioned on top of the character it
logically precedes.
.B
A "word" in the following discussion means any number
of consecutive letters, numbers, periods, percent
signs, dollar signs, and any surrounding tabs or
blanks.
.B
Examples:
Cx Change next character to "x".
4Cabcd Change the next 4 characters to "abcd".
-Cz Change the previous character to "z".
-2Cgo Change the previous two characters to "go".
.B
There are two classes of alter commands, immediate action, and those
that require a unit and a mode. These two types are discussed below.
.F;.B;.LM 16
.I-16;Syntax:	A range
.BR;Alter the line or lines specified by "range".
.B
A list of immediate action commands follows.
.B;.LM 16
.I-16;Command	Function
.B
.I-16;B		Insert a blank at the current cursor position.
.I-16;C		Change the next character to be whatever is typed
after the "C".
.I-16;D		Delete the character under the cursor.
.I-16;E		Exit alter mode on the current line; do not print the
rest of line. All changes made before "E" is typed
become permanent.
.I-16;I		Enter insert mode. Allows an arbitrary string to be
entered starting at the current cursor position and
ending with an ALTmode or ESCape.
.I-16;J		Join the next line to the end of the current line and
position the cursor at the start of the joined text.
.I-16;N		Print the rest of the current line, make the changes
indicated, and enter alter mode on the next line.
.I-16;O		Insert one character in the text. "nOc" will insert
"n" occurrences of "c" starting at the current cursor
position. "-nOc" is illegal.
.I-16;P		Print the rest of the line, and then reprint the line
number and the line up to the current cursor position.
.I-16;Q		Quit alter mode. None of the changes made to the line
are retained.
.I-16;T		Insert a tab at the current cursor position.
.I-16;X		Extend. Move to the end of the current line and enter
insert mode. T may be terminated by typing ALTmode or
ESCape. If a <CR> is typed while in eXtend mode, a
new line will be started if use of the global line
increment will allow room for a new line. If there is
not enough room for a new line, <CR> returns you to
SOS command mode. The <LF> character may be used to
insert new lines and have SOS compute a new line
number that will fit. The eXtend command may be
prefixed by a count which will be interpreted as a
suggested line increment.
.I-16;'		Insert the control equivalent of the character typed
after the apostrophe. For example, "'Z" inserts a
Control-Z in the line.
.I-16;+		Insert a copy of the character preceding the current
cursor position. "n+" inserts "n" copies of whatever
character precedes the current cursor position. "-n+"
is illegal.
.I-16;/		Transpose the next 2 characters.
.I-16;_;		Break the line at the current cursor position and
assign a new line number to the rest of the line. If
there is no room for a new line, "%ORDER" is printed
and the ";" is ignored.
.I-16;<CR>		Type the rest of the line and end the alter, making
all indicated changes to the line.
.I-16;<LF>		If in insert mode, break the line at the current
position and start a new line with whatever is left.
If no room remains for another line number, "%ORDER"
is printed, and the <LF> is ignored. If not in insert
mode, <LF> is treated as <CR>.
.I-16;_^R (Control-R)	Retype the current line up through the current cursor
position.
.I-16;RUBOUT		Back up the cursor 1 character if not in insert mode.
If in insert mode, it erases the previous character.
.I-16;_^U (Control-U)	Cancel all alterations on the current line and start
over.
.I-16;_^W (Control-W)	Backspace one word.
.B
The other class of alter commands work with a function to preform, and
a unit (range) to perform it to. The general format of these commands
is <optional signed repeat count number> <function> <unit>.
.b
The functions are:
.B
.I-16;K		Delete characters
.I-16;R		Replace characters (delete and enter insert mode)
.I-16;V		InVert case of characters
.I-16;_^		Upper case characters
.I-16;_\		Lower case characters
.I-16;<null>		Move the cursor position
.b
The units are:
.B
.I-16;<space>		Single character
.I-16;F<string>	Up to <string>
.I-16;G<string>	Up to and including <string>
.I-16;L		Entire line
.I-16;M<string>	Only to <string>
.I-16;S<char>		Up to <char>
.I-16;W		Word
.I-16;Z		To end of line
.B
For example, KW would delete a word, -3KW would delete the preceeding
three words, KSx would delete up to character "x", RW would replace a
word, W (null function) would skip a word, RZ would replace to end of
line, etc.

.I-16;_A/OLDALTER
.I-16;Purpose:	The "A" command causes SOS to enter intraline edit
mode. Once in this mode, any of the intraline edit
commands are valid. Unless otherwise noted, an
intraline edit command may be preceded by an integer
and/or a sign to modify its function. In general, a
positive integer preceding a command means "the next
<integer> occurrences", and a negative integer means
"the previous <integer> occurrences". If no integer
precedes a command, 1 is assumed. At all times, the
cursor is positioned between 2 characters or between a
character and one end of the line. The cursor will be
visually positioned on top of the character it
logically precedes.
.B
A "word" in the following discussion means any number
of consecutive letters, numbers, periods, percent
signs, dollar signs, and any surrounding tabs or
blanks.
.B
Examples:
Cx Change next character to "x".
4Cabcd Change the next 4 characters to "abcd".
-Cz Change the previous character to "z".
-2Cgo Change the previous two characters to "go".
.B
The table below gives some of the more frequently used alter
mode characters and their functions. The unit on which the
character operates is given at the top of each column, and the
effect of a given character is given down the left side. Thus
"X" will replace the next word by deleting it and entering
insert mode, allowing the user to type the replacement word.

.F;.B;.LM 16
.I-16;Syntax:	A range
.BR;Alter the line or lines specified by "range".
.B
A list of these commands follows.
.B;.LM 16
.I-16;Command	Function
.B
.I-16;B		Insert a blank at the current cursor position.
.I-16;C		Change the next character to be whatever is typed
after the "C".
.I-16;D		Delete the character under the cursor.
.I-16;E		Exit alter mode on the current line; do not print the
rest of line. All changes made before "E" is typed
become permanent.
.I-16;F		Find a string. Type "F<string to look for>$". This
will look for a string and place the cursor before the
start of the string if successful; if not successful
the bell is sounded at the user's terminal. RUBOUT
and Control-U may be used to erase incorrectly typed
characters when entering the search string. The
special search control characters used with the F(ind)
and S(ubstitute) commands are not allowed in alter
mode search strings.
.I-16;G		Identical to "F", except the cursor is positioned at
the end of the string.
.I-16;H		Hack (delete) the rest of the line and enter insert
mode.
.I-16;I		Enter insert mode. Allows an arbitrary string to be
entered starting at the current cursor position and
ending with an ALTmode or ESCape.
.I-16;J		Join the next line to the end of the current line and
position the cursor at the start of the joined text.
.I-16;K		Search for the single character typed after "K",
deleting all characters up to, but not including, the
specified character. If the character is not found,
nothing is deleted, the cursor is not moved, and the
bell is sounded at the user's terminal.
.I-16;L		List rest of line, reprint the line number and place
cursor at start of line.
.I-16;M		Similar to "F", but deletes the string and enters
insert mode.
.I-16;N		Print the rest of the current line, make the changes
indicated, and enter alter mode on the next line.
.I-16;O		Insert one character in the text. "nOc" will insert
"n" occurrences of "c" starting at the current cursor
position. "-nOc" is illegal.
.I-16;P		Print the rest of the line, and then reprint the line
number and the line up to the current cursor position.
.I-16;Q		Quit alter mode. None of the changes made to the line
are retained.
.I-16;R		Replace. Deletes the specified number of characters
and enters insert mode.
.I-16;S		Search for the character typed after the "S" and place
the cursor before it.
.I-16;T		Extend. Move to the end of the current line and enter
insert mode. T may be terminated by typing ALTmode or
ESCape. If a <CR> is typed while in eXtend mode, a
new line will be started if use of the global line
increment will allow room for a new line. If there is
not enough room for a new line, <CR> returns you to
SOS command mode. The <LF> character may be used to
insert new lines and have SOS compute a new line
number that will fit. The eXtend command may be
prefixed by a count which will be interpreted as a
suggested line increment.
.I-16;V		Invert the case of all letters in the next word.
.I-16;W		Skip word. Places the cursor at the start of the
next word when moving right, or at the start of the
last word skipped when moving left.
.I-16;X		Delete a word and enter insert mode.
.I-16;Y		Similar to "F", but deletes the string.
.I-16;Z		Delete a word.
.I-16;!		Similar to "K", but enters insert mode after deleting
all text up to, but not including, the character typed
after the "!".
.I-16;"		Invert the case of all characters up to the character
typed after the quote.
.I-16;'		Insert the control equivalent of the character typed
after the apostrophe. For example, "'Z" inserts a
Control-Z in the line.
.I-16;_#		InVert the case of all letters from current cursor
position to the end of line.
.I-16;+		Insert a copy of the character preceding the current
cursor position. "n+" inserts "n" copies of whatever
character precedes the current cursor position. "-n+"
is illegal.
.I-16;/		Transpose the next 2 characters.
.I-16;:		Delete the rest of the line.
.I-16;_;		Break the line at the current cursor position and
assign a new line number to the rest of the line. If
there is no room for a new line, "%ORDER" is printed
and the ";" is ignored.
.I-16;_\		Transpose the previous 2 characters.
.I-16;_^		Invert the case of the next character, if it is a
letter.
.I-16;<CR>		Type the rest of the line and end the alter, making
all indicated changes to the line.
.I-16;<LF>		If in insert mode, break the line at the current
position and start a new line with whatever is left.
If no room remains for another line number, "%ORDER"
is printed, and the <LF> is ignored. If not in insert
mode, <LF> is treated as <CR>.
.I-16;_^R (Control-R)	Retype the current line up through the current cursor
position.
.I-16;RUBOUT		Back up the cursor 1 character if not in insert mode.
If in insert mode, it erases the previous character.
.I-16;SPACE		Advance the cursor 1 character if not in insert mode;
inserts a blank in the text if used in insert mode.
.I-16;TAB (Control-I)	Move the cursor to the end of the current line.
.I-16;_^U (Control-U)	Cancel all alterations on the current line and start
over.
.I-16;_^W (Control-W)	Same as -W.

.BR; Copy the lines given by "range" after line "n" with an
increment of "inc1" to be used before a page mark, and
"inc2" to be used after a page mark. "inc1" and
"inc2" are optional.
.I-8;C n=file,range,inc1,inc2
.BR
Copy the lines given by "range" from "file" into the
file being edited after line "n". "inc1" and "inc2"
have the same meanings given above.
.I-8;C n=file
.BR
Enter search mode on "file". User can use any command
that does not alter "file" to find the lines to be
copied. When the lines are located, type "E" and SOS
will print "Source Lines=". The user then types a
range of lines to be copied into the file being
edited. "Range" may be suffixed by "inc1" and "inc2"
as above. If "EQ" is used to exit the file, SOS will
assume no lines are to be copied and will simply
return to normal edit mode.
.I-8;C n=file/S
.BR
Same as "C n=file".
.PAGE
.I-16;_CC

.BR
Same as "E", but begin SOSing "file" when done. If
"ER" is used, all strings for the last "F" and/or "S"
command are retained, as are most other attributes of
the current edit. If "R:file" is used, it must be the
last option in the list. /R may be suffixed to the
file specification to open the file in readonly mode.

.I-16;Purpose:	Allow selection of normal character input mode.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/C64
.BR;Select normal character input mode. This makes the
apostrophe an ordinary input character instead of a
special flag for control characters. This switch is
the inverse of /C128.

.I-16;Purpose:	Allow selection of special quoted-character input
mode.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/C128
.BR;Select special quoted-character input mode. This
makes the apostrophe a special character used for
entering control characters according to the following
table. Lower case text may be entered by typing an
apostrophe before each lower case character. This
switch is the inverse of /C64 and is useful only when
the terminal you are using has no control characters

.I-16;Purpose:	Enable Auto-decide mode on S(ubstitute) commands.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/DECIDE
.BR;When /DECIDE is used, SOS will print each line after
making the requested substitution, and wait for you to
type Carriage Return or <space> to accept the
substitution, RUBout to reject the substitution, or A
to enter alter mode on this line. If you enter alter
mode, type a carriage return to continue the
substitute command.
.B

.BR;Do not pause after making each substitution.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/DECRYPT
.I-16;Purpose:	Allow specification of a decryption password.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/DECRYPT
.BR;This switch tells SOS to ask for a decryption password
at the start of the edit. The password will not be
echoed at your terminal when you type it in. If there
is no password, simply type Carriage Return when SOS
asks for the password. The decryption password allows
you to read a file that has been previously encrypted
with SOS. If you give the wrong password, or try to
look at the file with something other than SOS, it
will appear to be garbage. Exiting by any other means
than EQ after having given an incorrect password may
result in the destruction of your file. /DECRYPT is
only valid on the SOS command line or in a SWITCH.INI
file.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/DEFINE
.I-16;Purpose:	To define a macro name
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/DEFINE:name:string
.BR;DEFINE the macro called "name" to be the text "string". "String"
itself may contain other macros, which may be expanded at definition
time (if expressed with single angle brackets <xxx>), or expanded
it invocation time (if expressed with double angle brackets <<xxx>>).
See also /LDEFINE, /MACRO, /PURGE for related information.

.I-16;_/DELETE
.I-16;Purpose:	Allow SOS to delete the input file when ED is typed
without asking for verification.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/DELETE
.BR;If ED is typed and the input file is in readonly mode
or is different from the output file, SOS will delete
the input file without asking for verification. If
the file is write protected, the ED request is treated
as an E request.
.I-8;/NODELETE
.BR;Require SOS to ask for verification when ED is typed.
You may respond with either "Y" or "N" followed by a
Carriage Return. If "Y" is entered, SOS will proceed
just as though /DELETE had been present. If "N" is
typed, the ED request is treated as an E request.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/DISK
.I-16;Purpose:	List disk quotas for your current job and PPN.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	=DISK
.BR;The current disk quotas for your job and PPN, as well as the
total space available to the system are listed.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/DISPLAY
.I-16;Purpose:	To allow optimum display handling for a given terminal.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/DISPLAY
.BR;This switch enables SOS to do optimum display handling
for the given terminal type as set to the monitor with
the TERMINAL TYPE xxxx command.
.B
It will enable the following, depending on the type of
terminal:
.B
Special handling of <rub>, _^U, _^R, _^W.
.B
Backspace up a line when print commands are given.
.B
Allow continuous update of a line in alter mode which
causes SOS to continually update the line being
altered so that its current state is always displayed
on the terminal screen. Please note that this switch
is not useful at transmission rates of less than 600
baud because of the time required to update the entire
line after a character is inserted or deleted from the
middle of the line. Refer to /DPY, /DPYALT, and /LF
for additional display features.
.B
.I-8;/NODISPLAY
.BR;Disable the display features.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/DPY
.I-16;Purpose:	Enable CRT display mode for editing.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/DPY
.BR;This switch causes SOS to process RUBouts, _^R, and _^U
itself. When a RUBout is entered, SOS will erase the
deleted characters from the screen. This feature is
especially useful in alter mode when backing up the
cursor, as the cursor will simply move across the line
without echoing characters. When _^R is typed, SOS
retypes the line up to the current cursor position.
When _^U is typed, SOS reprints the line number, but
forgets the rest of the line. Refer to /C64, /C128,
/M33, /M37, /LOWER, /STANDARD, and /UPPER for
additional information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/DPYALT
.I-16;Purpose:	Position the cursor at end-of-line and enter alter
mode from Insert mode when a ALTmode or ESCape is
typed.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/DPYALT
.BR;If /ALTER is used, but /DPYALT is not, SOS will enter
alter mode after prompting you with the current line
number. With /DPYALT enabled, SOS will enter alter
mode at the end of the current line. /DPYALT also
selects /ALTER. /DPYALT is intended primarily for use
with /DPY, but functions with /STANDARD also.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/DSK
.I-16;Purpose:	List disk quotas for your current job and PPN.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	=DSK
.BR;The current disk quotas for your job and PPN, as well as the
total space available to the system are listed.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/ENCRYPT
.I-16;Purpose:	Allow specification of a encryption password.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/ENCRYPT
.BR;This switch tells SOS to ask for an encryption
password for the input file and for the output file at
the start of the edit. The password will not be
echoed at your terminal when you type it in. If there
is no password for a file, simply type Carriage Return
when SOS requests the password for that file.
Encryption of a file means that someone who does not
know the password cannot interpret the data in the
file. Thus, if you give the wrong the password for
the file, or try to look at it with anything but SOS,
it will appear to be garbage. Exiting by any other
means than EQ after having given an incorrect password
may result in the destruction of your file. /ENCRYPT
is only valid on the SOS command line or in a
SWITCH.INI file.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/ERROR
.I-16;Purpose:	To list the long form on the last error message.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	=ERROR
.br;The long form of the last error message is printed. This is useful
if /EXPERT is in effect, as /EXPERT outputs the short form of an error
message.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/EXACT
.I-16;Purpose:	Require exact case match in search strings on F(ind)
and S(ubstitute) commands.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/EXACT
.BR;Require exact case match in search strings on F and S
commands.
.I-8;/NOEXACT
.BR;Do not require exact case match in search strings on F
and S commands.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/EXPERT
.I-16;Purpose:	This command tells SOS that you are an experienced
user.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/EXPERT
.BR;This command causes SOS to use 3 character
abbreviations for error messages, with the full text
of the message available for your inspection by
typing "=ERROR". SOS will not ask for verification
when a D(elete) or R(eplace) that would remove an
entire page is attempted. In addition, SOS will allow
the D and R commands to be used without a period
(e.g., "D" becomes an acceptable substitute for "D.").
/EXPERT is the inverse of /NOVICE.
.I-8;/NOEXPERT
.BR;This command, which is equivalent to /NOVICE, causes
SOS to use full length error messages instead of 3
character abbreviations. SOS will ask for
verification when a D(elete) or R(eplace) that would
remove an entire page is attempted. In addition, SOS
will not allow the D and R commands to be used without
a period (e.g., "D" is not an acceptable substitute
for "D.").

.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/FILLCLASS:n
.BR;Set the fill class for the terminal to "n". "n" may
be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Note that /FILLCLASS:0 is equivalent to
the monitor command
.B
_.SET TTY NO FILL
.I-8;/NOFILL
.BR;Set the fill class for the terminal to 0. /NOFILL is
equivalent to /FILLCLASS:0 and to the monitor command
.B
_.SET TTY NO FILL
.PAGE
.I-16;_/INCREMENT
.I-16;Purpose:	Establish an initial value for the default global line

.I-16;Purpose:	List line numbers of first and last lines (D)eleted or
(R)eplaced.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/INFORM
.BR;This switch tells SOS to type out how many lines were
deleted by a D or R command, as well as the range of
those lines.
.I-8;/NOINFORM
.BR;This switch tells SOS not to type out the numbers of
the lines affected by a D or R command.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/INITIALIZE
.I-16;Purpose:	To automatically perform setup functions when SOS
is started.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/INITIALIZE
.BR;The file SOS.INI is invoked as though it was an
indirect command file, and the actions are taken
accordingly. This happens whenever SOS is first
started.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/INSERT
.I-16;Purpose:	Cause SOS to prompt you with the first available line
number when creating a new file.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/INSERT
.BR;This switch tells SOS to automatically enter I(nsert)
mode when creating a new file.
.I-8;/NOINSERT
.BR;This switch causes SOS to prompt you with an asterisk
when creating a new file instead of prompting you with
a line number.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/ISAVE
.I-16;Purpose:	Make SOS automatically save the state of the file
after a selected number of lines is added.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/ISAVE:n
.BR;Make SOS automatically save the state of the file if
"n" lines have been inserted since the last time the

.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/LDEFINE:name:range
.BR;Define the macro "name" to be the resolved text form of the "range".
Any single line specifier or a range specifier is legal. All special
symbols and addition/subtraction will be resolved at definition time.
For example, /LDEFINE:XX:200/.+1:*-5/10 might define XX as 00200/6:05500/10.
See also /DEFINE, /MACRO, and /PURGE for related information.
.PAGE

.I-16;Purpose:	This switch tells SOS that you are not an expert user.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/NOVICE
.BR;This command, which is equivalent to /NOEXPERT, causes
SOS to use full length error messages instead of 3
character abbreviations. SOS will ask for
verification when a D(elete) or R(eplace) that would
remove an entire page is attempted. In addition, SOS
will not allow the D and R commands to be used without
a period (e.g., "D" is not an acceptable substitute
for "D."). /NOVICE is the inverse of /EXPERT.

.I-16;_/OLDCOMMAND
.I-16;Purpose:	To select an old command set, compatible with SOS version 21.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/OLDCOMMAND
.BR;This makes commands that may have changed, compatible
with SOS version 21/23 as much as possible, sometimes
sacrificing new features or cleaner command
implementations. This has the following effects:
.B
/QZBAK is the default. This writes *.Q?? and *.Z??
backup files.
.B
/EXPERT defaults /NOINFORM, /NOVICE defaults /INFORM.
.B
Exit options S and B mean unsequence and nobackup,
respectively.
.B
N is treated like NF (renumber file) instead of
renumbering the current page only.
.B
The default STEP and START are 100, and not 10.
.B
In alter mode, V means invert case of word, _# means
invert case to the end of the line, X means replace
the current word, and T means to extend the line.
.B
.I-8;/NEWCOMMAND
.BR;Disables /OLDCOMMAND, and the associated changed

.I-16;_/QZBAK
.I-16;Purpose:	Allow two levels of backup files in a manner similar
to DEC release SOS.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/QZBAK
.BR;When this switch is selected, the .BAK file will be
given the extension of the form .Qxx, where xx is the
last two letters in the original extension. For
example, if the original extension was .MAC, the
backup file with /QZBAK selected would become .QAC.
Also, the .OLD file will be given an extension of .Zxx. Use of this 
switch allows a user to keep backup files from files of the same 
name but with different extensions simultaneously. Refer to /OLD 
and /BAK for additional information.
.B
.I-8;/NOBAK
.BR;This switch disables /BAK, /OLD, and /QZBAK, thus
preventing creation of any backup files by SOS.
.B
.I-8;/NOQZBAK
.BR;This switch disables /QZBAK without affecting /BAK or
/OLD.

.I-16;_/R
.I-16;Purpose:	Look at a file in Readonly mode.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/R
.BR;This switch allows you to look at a file in a manner
that prevents alterations to the file. Use of this
switch saves most of the overhead of scanning a file,
and this in turn speeds up the scanning process. Note
that if "ED" is used to exit a file for which /R is
selected, SOS will attempt to delete the file as
described under /DELETE. /R can only be turned off by
exiting SOS. Refer to /X for additional information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/READONLY
.I-16;Purpose:	Look at a file in Readonly mode.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/READONLY
.BR;This switch allows you to look at a file in a manner
that prevents alterations to the file. Use of this
switch saves most of the overhead of scanning a file,
and this in turn speeds up the scanning process. Note
that if "ED" is used to exit a file for which /READONLY is
selected, SOS will attempt to delete the file as
described under /DELETE. /READONLY can only be turned off by
exiting SOS. Refer to /X for additional information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/REFDLY
.I-16;Purpose:	Establish a delay time for screen refreshes.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/REFDLY:n
.BR;This switch allows you to establish a minimum delay
time before the screen is refreshed when /DISPLAY is
selected. Normally, SOS will refresh the line after
each character is entered. If /REFDLY:n is selected,
SOS will refresh the line only if "n" milliseconds
have elapsed since the last character was typed in.
This reduces the number of characters transmitted to
the terminal, while still maintaining the convenience
of continuous updates.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/RONLY
.I-16;Purpose:	Look at a file in RONLY mode.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/RONLY
.BR;This switch allows you to look at a file in a manner
that prevents alterations to the file. Use of this
switch saves most of the overhead of scanning a file,
and this in turn speeds up the scanning process. Note
that if "ED" is used to exit a file for which /RONLY is
selected, SOS will attempt to delete the file as
described under /DELETE. /RONLY can only be turned off by
exiting SOS. Refer to /X for additional information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/RMAR
.I-16;Purpose:	Set the right margin for SOS text justification.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/RMAR:n
.BR;This switch sets the right margin for text
justification to character position "n". The left
most character position in any line is considered to
be position 1.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/RULER
.I-16;Purpose:	Provide a ruler for aligns columns.
.B
Syntax: =RULER
A ruler labeling the columns will be typed out. It is
of the form:
123456789 123456789 .... to terminal width
.PAGE
.I-16;_/RUN
.I-16;Purpose:	This switch allows setting the name of the program to
be run in response to a "G" command.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/RUN:file spec
.BR;This will cause the program given by "file spec" to
be run when SOS is exited with a "G" command. The
default program is "SYS:COMPIL", which will cause the
last EXECUTE, LOAD, etc., command to be repeated.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/SAVE
.I-16;Purpose:	Make SOS automatically save the state of the file
after a selected number of modifications is made.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/SAVE:n
.BR;Make SOS automatically save the state of the file if
"n" lines have been modified since the last time the
file was saved. This feature can minimize the loss of
entered data in the event of an interruption of
computer service. Refer to /ISAVE for additional file
preservation capabilities.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/SEPARATOR
.I-16;Purpose:	Allow "%", "$", and "." to be treated as delimiters in
F(ind) and S(ubstitute) commands.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/SEPARATOR
.BR;This switch causes "%", "$", and "." to be treated as
separators in F and S commands. A separator is
normally defined as any character which is not a
letter, number, "$", "%", or ".".
.B
.I-8;/NOSEPARATOR
.BR;This switch restores the default condition of treating
"$", "%", and "." in the same manner as letters and
digits in F and S commands.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/SEQUENCE
.I-16;Purpose:	Force sequence numbering of the SOS output file.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/SEQUENCE
.BR;This switch results in SOS writing a sequence numbered
output file in response to an "E", "G", or "W" command
that does not specify "S", "U", or "X".
.I-8;/NOSEQUENCE
.BR;This switch, which is equivalent to /UNSEQUENCE,
results in SOS writing an unsequence numbered output
file in response to an "E", "G", or "W" command that
does not specify "S", "U", or "X".
.PAGE
.I-16;_/STANDARD
.I-16;Purpose:	Inform SOS that you are using a standard terminal.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/STANDARD
.BR;This switch informs SOS that the terminal in use is
neither a CRT nor a Model 33 or 37 Teletype. SOS will
process _^R, _^U, and RUBout itself. When _^R is typed,
the entire line, including the line number, will be
retyped up to the current cursor position. _^U will
cause the line number to be retyped, but the rest of
the line will be forgotten. RUBout will cause the
characters passed over to be echoed, but they will be
separated from the rest of the line by backslashes.
Lower case text, special characters, and control
characters are entered into the file by using the
terminal keyboard, rather than by depending on SOS for
character translations. Refer to /C64, /C128, /DPY,
/LOWER, /M33, /M37, and /UPPER for additional
information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/START
.I-16;Purpose:	Define the default starting value to use for the first
line number on each page when reading in an
unsequenced file.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/START:n
.BR;Set the default value for the first line number on
each page of an unsequenced file to "n". This switch
may be selected only on the SOS command line or via a
SWITCH.INI file.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/STEP
.I-16;Purpose:	Define the default line increment to use for numbering
each line on a given page when reading in an
unsequenced file.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/STEP:n
.BR;Set the default value for the line increment on a
given page of an unsequenced file to "n". This switch
may be selected only on the SOS command line or via a
SWITCH.INI file.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/STRING
.I-16;Purpose:	To list the current strings used in the last F(ind) and
S(ubstitute) command.
.I-16;Syntax:	=STRING
.BR;The strings used in the last F(ind) and S(ubstitute) command are
listed. If no strings are given in a F or S command, these strings
will be used again.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/TELL
.I-16;Purpose:	To inform the user what file name SOS used for output.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/TELL
.BR;This switch will cause SOS to type out the name of its
output file after a "E", "G", or "W" command is used.
.I-8;/NOTELL
.BR;This switch will prevent SOS from typing out the name
of its output file after an "E", "G", or "W" command
is used.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/TEXT
.I-16;Purpose:	Enable entry of lower case text.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/TEXT
.BR;Allow letters not specifically typed as upper case
text to be interpreted as lower case text in the same
manner as the monitor commands
.B
_.SET TTY LC
or
_.SET TTY NO UC
.PAGE
.I-16;_/UC
.I-16;Purpose:	Disable entry of lower case text.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/UC
.BR;This command causes all text to be interpreted as
upper case text in the same manner as the monitor
commands
.B
_.SET TTY NO LC
or
_.SET TTY UC
.I-8;/NOUC
.BR;Allow letters not specifically typed as upper case
text to be interpreted as lower case text in the same
manner as the monitor commands
.B
_.SET TTY LC
or
_.SET TTY NO UC
.PAGE
.I-16;_/UNSEQUENCE
.I-16;Purpose:	Inhibit sequence numbering of the SOS output file.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/UNSEQUENCE
.BR;This switch, which is equivalent to /NOSEQUENCE,
results in SOS writing an unsequence numbered output
file in response to an "E", "G", or "W" command that
does not specify "S", "U", or "X".
.PAGE
.I-16;_/UPPER
.I-16;Purpose:	Make upper case the default input mode for characters
typed on a Model 33 Teletype.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/UPPER
.BR;This switch makes all letters entered into a file be
in upper case unless the letter is preceded by an
apostrophe. When /UPPER is set, lower case characters
in a line printed by SOS will be preceded by an
apostrophe. Refer to /C64, /C128, /DPY, /M33, /M37,
/STANDARD, and /LOWER for additional information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/WIDTH
Purpose: /WIDTH allows setting of the terminal line width.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/WIDTH:n
.BR;This switch will set the terminal line width to "n"
characters. "n" must lie between 16 and 200
inclusive. If more than "n" characters are typed on a
line, the operating system will break the line
visually at your terminal and move the carriage to the
beginning of the next line. The setting of this
switch has no effect on the data entered in the file.
To have a Carriage Return automatically inserted in
the file at specified intervals, see /CRLF.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/WINDOW
.I-16;Purpose:	This switch allows you to change the size of the SOS
edit window.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/WINDOW:n
.BR;"n" is the size of the in-core window to the file and
defaults to about 1620 (decimal) words. If "n" is
less than or equal to 256, it is the window size in
nK;if greater than 256, it is the size in words.
Larger window sizes can speed up editing on large
files, but may degrade your response, as SOS will need
more core. If the value of "n" is so large that SOS
cannot get enough core to satisfy it, SOS will use the
default window size. See /WMAXIMUM, /WMINIMUM, and
/WRATIO for additional information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/WMAXIMUM
.I-16;Purpose:	This switch allows you to change the size of the
largest possible edit window.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/WMAXIMUM:n
.BR;"n" is the size of the largest possible in-core window
to the file and defaults to 12K (decimal) words. If
"n" is less than or equal to 256, it is the maximum
window size in nK;if greater than 256, it is the
size in words. SOS divides the file size by the value
of /WRATIO, and then uses the result as the window
size. If the computed size would be less than the
/WMINIMUM value, the /WMINIMUM is used. If the
computed size would exceed /WMAXIMUM, the /WMAXIMUM
value is used. A user specified /WINDOW value will
override the SOS computed value. Larger window sizes
can speed up editing on large files, but may degrade
your response, as SOS will need more core. Refer to
/WINDOW, /WMINIMUM, and /WRATIO for additional
information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/WMINIMUM
.I-16;Purpose:	This switch allows you to change the size of the
smallest possible edit window.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/WMINIMUM:n
.BR;"n" is the size of the smallest possible in-core
window to the file and defaults to 1K (decimal) words.
If "n" is less than or equal to 256, it is the minimum
window size in nK;if greater than 256, it is the
size in words. SOS divides the file size by the value
of /WRATIO, and then uses the result as the window
size. If the computed size would be less than the
/WMINIMUM value, the /WMINIMUM is used. If the
computed size would exceed /WMAXIMUM, the /WMAXIMUM
value is used. A user specified /WINDOW value will
override the SOS computed value. Larger window sizes
can speed up editing on large files, but may degrade
your response, as SOS will need more core. Refer to
/WINDOW, /WMAXIMUM, and /WRATIO for additional
information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/WRATIO
.I-16;Purpose:	This switch allows you to change the number SOS uses
to compute the initial window size from the file size.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/WRATIO:n
.BR;"n" is the number SOS will divide into the file size
to get an initial estimate for a window size. /WRATIO
defaults to 4. If the computed size would be less
than the /WMINIMUM value, the /WMINIMUM is used. If
the computed size would exceed /WMAXIMUM, the
/WMAXIMUM value is used. A user specified /WINDOW
value will override the SOS computed value. Larger
window sizes can speed up editing on large files, but
may degrade your response, as SOS will need more core.
Values of /WRATIO in excess of 10 will greatly impair
your response. Refer to /WINDOW, /WMAXIMUM, and
/WMINIMUM for additional information.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/X
.I-16;Purpose:	Look at a file in eXamine mode.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/X
.BR;This switch allows you to look at a file in a manner
that prevents alterations to the file. Use of this
switch saves most of the overhead of scanning a file,
and this in turn speeds up the scanning process. Note
that if "ED" is used to exit a file for which /X is
selected, SOS will attempt to delete the file as
described under /DELETE. /X can only be turned off by
exiting SOS. If the file is unsequenced, /X is the
same as /R plus /NONUMBER. If the file is sequenced,
/X is equivalent to /R.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/XINSERT
.I-16;Purpose:	To control the inserting of new lines in eXtend mode.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/XINSERT
.BR;Allow new lines to be inserted if <CR> is typed in
eXtend mode, and the global line increment allows such
a line.
.I-8;/NOXINSERT
.BR;Do not allow new lines to be inserted if a <CR> is
typed in eXtend mode.
.PAGE
.I-16;_/XSEQUENCE
.I-16;Purpose:	Write the SOS output file in the same sequencing
format as the SOS input file.
.B
.I-16;Syntax:	/XSEQUENCE
.BR;This switch results in SOS writing a file whose
sequencing format is the same as that of the input
file. If a file is being created, /XSEQUENCE is the
same as /UNSEQUENCE. "S", "U", or "X" can be used on
an "E", "G", or "W" command to override this switch
setting.
