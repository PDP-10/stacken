;THIS IS A UNIVERSAL FILE GENERATED BY S.WELLS. IT CONTAINS
;FREQUENTLY USED SYMBOLS AND MACRO DEFINITIONS.

;THE FOLLOWING MACRO DEFINES THE PROGRAM NAME AND COMPLETE
;VERSION NUMBER FOR A PROGRAM. IT ALSO INSERTS THE PROGRAMMER'S
;NAME IN A LISTED COMMENT LINE, AND DESCRIBES HOW TO CHANGE THE VERSION 
;NUMBERS.

;WHEN M0DIFYING THIS PROGRAM, PLEASE CONFORM TO THE FOLLOWING RULES:

;	1.MAJOR AND MINOR VERSION NUMBERS SHOULD BE CHANGED BY
;	  DIGITAL EMPLOYEES ONLY.
;	2.MINOR VERSION NUMBERS ARE BLANK IF NOT USED
;	3.MINOR VERSION NUMBERS ARE A-Z IF USED.
;	4.EDIT NUMBERS ARE INCREASED BY 1 FOR EACH SEPERATE EDIT
;	  THEY ARE NEVER RESET.
;	5.THE GROUP NUMBER ASSIGNMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
;		0 = DIGITAL PROGRAM AUTHOR
;		1 = DIGITAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL
;		2-4 = DIGITAL CUSTOMER PERSONNEL
;		5-7 = CUSTOMER' USERS (IE, CUSTOMER'S CUSTOMERS)
