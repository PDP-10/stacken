FUR is  a File  Utility Routine  for disk  manipulation.  It
allows you  to copy, rename,  change protection,  and delete
files based on file names and file characteristics.  Some of
the salient features are:


   o  File copying  is ten times  faster than  the normal
      system copying utility.

   o  Files can be  scrambled or unscrambled as  they are
      copied.

   o  You can have FUR ask you whether or not  to perform
      the operation on each file that FUR finds.

   o  Full wildcard operations are possible.

   o  Indirect command  files and SWITCH.INI  options can
      be set.

   o  A mode  allows copying  files only  if they  do not
      overwrite existing files.

   o  File attribute  information such as  version number
      can be set or changed.



                         Section 2

                       How to Use FUR                       ___ __ ___ ___




The FUR program  is invoked with  the command "R  FUR".  The
prompt from FUR is a slash.


2.A  Commands___  ________


Commands  are  used   to  direct  FUR's   action.   Switches
(described  later  in  Section  2.C  on  page  12)  are used
to modify the actions of the commands.

2.A.1  COPY_____  ____


The COPY  verb is  used to start  a file  copying operation.
The format of the COPY command is

     /COPY <output-file>=<input file list>

The  output file  is  given using  normal  DECsystem-10 file
specifications.  Wild cards are legal, and will be filled in
using  the  corresponding information  from  the  input file
being  copied.   The  input   file  list  is  a   series  of
specifications  separated  by  commas,  plus  signs,  or the
connectives 'AND', 'OR', or 'NOT'.  If commas are  used, the
files  are copied  in the  given order.   If plus  signs are
used, FUR (and WILD)  is allowed to re-arrange the  order in
which files are copied to optimize disk search time but they
must all be in the same directory.

If two file specifications  are separated by 'OR' or  a plus
sign, FUR copies files which match the file specification on
the left  OR the  file specification on  the right.   If two
file specifications are separated by 'AND', FUR copies files
which  match   BOTH  file   specifications.   If   two  file
specifications  are  separated by  'NOT',  FUR  copies files
which  match the  first  specification but  NOT  the second.
Parentheses and nesting of operations are not  allowed.  The
'NOT' operation cannot  be used as  a unary not.   (See page
10 for more information.)



If  the  DECIDE  switch  (see page  12)  is  in  effect, FUR
proposes  each   file  transfer  and   asks  the   user  for
confirmation  before proceeding.   If ENCRYPTION  is  in use
(see page 19), the file  is encrypted or decrypted as  it is
copied.  If  /ERSUPERSEDE is  in effect  (see page  14), the
COPY  command will  not  overwrite existing  files.   All of
these options are discussed later in more detail.

Each  input  file   creates  one  output  file   unless  the
CONCATENATE (see page 13) switch has been set.   The copying
proceeds without intervention  unless the DECIDE  switch has
been set.  A  record of the  copy is printed  unless BEQUIET
(see  page 13)  has  been set.   This record  will  show the
output file,  the input  file, and the  length of  the input
file being copied.

FUR normally copies the file attributes of the input file to
the output file.  The output file therefore normally has the
same dates,  protection codes, version  number, etc.  as the
input file.  The  NEWFILE switch (see  page 15) can  be used
to prevent the file attributes from being copied.

FUR  takes special  action when  copying directory  files in
order to create the UFD or SFD without placing file names or
directory pointers  within it.  Therefore,  FUR can  be used
for  total disk-to-disk  copies because  it will  create the
directories  it  needs  before  it  needs  them.    All  RIB
parameters are preserved including disk quotas.




Examples:
     Copy the file TSTPRG.FOR to NEWPRG.FOR
             /COPY NEWPRG.FOR=TSTPRG.FOR
     Copy the file MEETNG.LST from [541,40,MEETNG]
             /COPY =MEETNG.LST[541,40,MEETNG]
     Copy the file FUR.MAC to FUR.WRK
             /COPY .WRK=FUR.MAC
     Make a copy of help files beginning with W
             /COPY =HLP:W*
     Copy all of file structure DSKG: to PAKW:
             /BEQUIET ! to cut down on printing
             /COPY PAKW:[*,*,*,*,*,*,*]=DSKG:[*,*,*,*,*,*,*]
     Combine all system FACT files together into one file
             /CONCATENATE ! put following files together
             /COPY MYFACT.SYS=SYS:FACT.*
     Copy the file A.B to a file named just A
             /COPY A.=A.B
             /!The dot after the A is necessary to prevent
             /!the extension B from being copied too
     Copy all files beginning with BLI but not REL files
             /COPY =PAKD:[10,6]BLI*.* 'NOT' *.REL
     Copy files created since February 1st with less
     than 100 blocks
             /COPY =PAKD:[10,6]/SINCE:1-FEB/LENGTH::100
     Copy all files *.APL without overwriting
     any existing files
             /ERSUPERSEDE
             /COPY =*.APL[13,300]
     Copy file A.B[44,55] to your disk area with protection
     code 157 and changing the version number to 1(1)
             /COPY /PROT:157/VERSION:1(1)=A.B[44,55]

During execution of the COPY command, statistics are kept on
how quickly the transfer  is taking place.  If  the transfer
lasts  long  enough  to  get  good  statistics,  the average
transfer rate in kilobaud  is printed.  One kilobaud  is one
thousand bits in one second.  Therefore a 10 second transfer
at 100 Kbaud will move 1 million bits.

During the COPY command, FUR will normally increase its core
size so that it can  move large amounts of information  in a
single I/O  operation.  This technique  makes FUR  much more
efficient than  other file copying  programs (such  as PIP),
sometimes  as much  as 10:1.   The large  amount of  core is
given back  at the  end of the  copying operation.   (If you
wish  to restrict  the amount  of core  which FUR  uses when



copying, use the monitor SET PHYSICAL LIMIT command prior to
running FUR.)

2.A.2  DELETE_____  ______


The DELETE command  is used to  delete files.  FUR  takes an
input  file list  just like  the COPY  command.   The DECIDE
switch is particularly useful in order to decide which files
are to be deleted.

After the file  name, FUR prints  the number of  disk blocks
freed.  This can  be larger than the  length of the  data in
the file  because it includes  the overhead  information the
file system keeps.  For example, "DSKC:ABC.REL 5" means that
the file  DSKC:ABC.REL has  been deleted  and 5  disk blocks
have been freed.   At the end  of all deletions,  FUR prints
the total number of disk blocks freed.

     Delete all files named TSTPRG with any extension
             /DELETE TSTPRG.*
     Delete TSTPRG.FOR and TSTPRG.REL
             /DELETE TSTPRG.FOR,TSTPRG.REL
     Decide about deleting files with the extension REL
             /DELETE *.REL/DECIDE
     Delete all .TMP files not accessed in last 30 days
             /DELETE ALL:.TMP[*,*,*,*,*]/ABEFORE:-30D
     Delete all files in SFD [,,PLOTX,OLD]
             /DELETE [,,PLOTX,OLD]
     Delete *.TMP except NEWS.TMP
             /DELETE *.TMP 'NOT' NEWS.TMP

If the file you have  asked FUR to delete cannot  be deleted
(even though you own the file) because you have protected it
against accidental deletion (say <777>), FUR will ask if you
would like to delete it anyway.  If you answer "Y", FUR will
first change the protection  code and then delete  the file.
Different things happen by default when the /OVERRIDE switch
is used.  See page 14 for more information on /OVERRIDE.

2.A.3  ERASE_____  _____


The ERASE command is used to erase a disk file or a magnetic
tape.

A disk file is erased  by writing blocks of zeroes  over the



data.  The file itself is  then deleted since a file  of all
zero bytes is pretty useless.

Simply deleting a file  is normally an adequate way  to keep
the data private.  The monitor protects the privacy of files
which have been deleted  by not allowing the  deleted blocks
to  be read  until they  have been  re-written by  their new
owner.  File erasure is an extraordinary measure which makes
the  data inaccessible  even  to privileged  jobs  which can
bypass the file system and read disk packs without regard to
the file structure.

If  the ERASE  command names  a device  which is  a magnetic
tape, FUR issues an TU-70 Data Security Erase function which
will cause a TU-70 to  wipe the entire tape clean.   A write
ring is necessary.

     Erase magnetic tape MTA3:
             /ERASE MTA3:

2.A.4  RENAME_____  ______


The RENAME command is used  to change the names of  files or
move  them  to  different  PPNs or  SFDs  on  the  same disk
structure.   This  command  is  also  used  to  change  file
protection codes  and to  add or  change version  numbers on
disk files.  The command takes the same format as  COPY (see
page 1).  Instead of  copying the data, the file  is removed
from  the  present  name/directory  and  placed  in  the new
name/directory.

Files  may  not  be  RENAMEd  across  file  structures.  The
message INCORRECT  PPN is an  indication that this  is being
attempted.  The output  device specification is not  used in
the RENAME command, and it is ignored.

The  protection  of  a  file can  be  changed  by  using the
/PROTECTION switch.   This is the  proper way to  change the
protection of  a file.  Similarly,  the version number  of a
file can be changed by using the /VERSION switch.



     Change the name of TSTPRG.FOR to TSTPRG.F10
             /RENAME .F10=TSTPRG.FOR
     Protect file A.DAT against other people's reading it
             /RENAME /PROT:077=A.DAT
     Move file A.B from [13,20] to [13,11]
             /RENAME [13,11]=A.B[13,20]
     Move PLOTS.* to [,,PLOTX,OLD] FROM [,,PLOTX,NEW]
             /RENAME [,,PLOTX,OLD]=PLOTS[,,PLOTX,NEW]
     Protect all files on PAK3:[10,*] with code 055
             /RENAME /PR:055=PAK3:[10,*]
     Put version number "23B(14)" on file ABC.SAI
             /RENAME /VERSION:23B(14)=ABC.SAI

2.A.5  PAD_____  ___


The PAD verb is used to pad files with null blocks.  This is
useful   in   protecting  ISAM$$ISAM   is   COBOL's  Indexed
Sequential Access Method.  It allows files to be stored in a
sequential order but  retrieved based on key  values.* files
from system crashes.  The format of the PAD verb is:

     /PAD value <file list>

The  file list  is a  series of  specifications  in standard
DECsystem-10 format separated by commas.  There can  only be
one  value  per  command   line  and  it  applies   to  each
specification  on  the  same  line.   The  value  must  be a
positive non-zero integer and may be followed with  a suffix
indicating  either  Words  (W), Blocks  (B),  Pages  (P), or
thousands of words (K).  If no suffix is seen blocks are the
default.  The value  may also be  specified in one  of three
ways.  You can specify  an absolute length for the  file and
pads will be added to arrive at that length.

     e.g. /PAD 10 TEST.FIL

will pad the  file TEST.FIL with  enough blocks to  make its
size  equal to  10  blocks.  Or  you can  specify  a certain
number of null blocks (words, etc..) to add to the file.

     e.g. /PAD +10 TEST.FIL
will add 10  null blocks to the  file TEST.FIL.  Or  you can
specify a  multiplication factor by  which to arrive  at the
final file size.

     e.g. /PAD *2 TEST.FIL



will pad the file TEST.FIL  until it has grown to  twice its
original  size.  NOTE:  When  you  specify  a multiplication
factor you cannot use the suffixes mentioned above.

Examples:
     To add 10 null blocks to the file TEST.IDA
             /PAD +10B TEST.IDA
     To pad file MYPROG.IDX out to 100 pages
             /PAD 100P MYPROG.IDX
     To pad files ACCNT.DAT & AACNT.DAT to twice their size
             /PAD *2 ACCNT.DAT,AACNT.DAT

The PAD verb will not let you specify a pad size  that would
result in a decrease of the file's original size.

General Guidelines:

ISAM  data  files should  be  padded with  enough  free null
blocks to  contain the expected  number of additions  to the
data file  before it  is maintained  by the  ISAM processor.
The user is expected to be able to approximate the volume of
additions and thus be  able to calculate the amount  of free
space needed.

ISAM index files are handled similarly to data files and the
volume and placement of additions to the file have  a direct
bearing on the stability  of the file.  On  extremely active
index files it is a  good idea to pad the index  with enough
free blocks to double its size.  If the index file  is built
with  a  large  percentage  of  empty  space  initially then
decrease the pad amount accordingly.

For additional information on ISAM files please refer to the
DECsystem-10 Cobol Users Guide (Order # DEC-10-LCUGA-B-D).

2.A.6  FIND_____  ____


The FIND command attempts  to find the list of  input files.
Its function  is similar to  that of the  DIRECTORY command,
but its repertoire is much more limited.  The prime function
of the FIND  command is to  locate files for  FUR operations
without having to leave FUR.  Besides showing the file name,
size (in blocks), protection  code (if not <055>  or <155>),
creation  date,  and  version  number,  FUR  will  print "NO
BACKUP" if the  NOBACKUP bit (RF.NFS)  is set (see  page 8),
and  will print  the  author of  the file  (his/her  PPN) if
different from the directory in which the file is found.



     Look to see how many *.Q?? SOS backup files exist
             /FIND *.Q??

2.A.7  BACKUP and NOBACKUP_____  ______ ___ ________


If you are privileged, you can set the RP.NFS bit in  a file
so that the  file will not be  saved by BACKUP  or FAILSAFE.
The FUR command  NOBACKUP sets this bit.   The complementary
command BACKUP restores the file to normal status so that it
will be backed up.

     Set the no backup bit on files manually selected
     from those that have extension DAT
             /NOBACKUP *.DAT/DECIDE

2.A.8  QUIT_____  ____


The QUIT command returns to monitor level from FUR.

     Exit from FUR
             /Q

The command EXIT may also be used.

2.A.9  ISAMDUMP_____  ________


The ISAMDUMP command takes a list of file names as arguments
and prints out details of the *.IDX block that  controls the
COBOL ISAM file.

     Dump information about SERVSZ.IDX
             /ISAMDUMP SERVSZ


2.B  File Selection___  ____ _________


2.B.1  Wildcards_____  _________


FUR allows the character "*"  to stand for any file  name or
extension  and  "?"  to stand  for  any  one  character.  To
specify all files, use "*.*".  (To help prevent  errors, FUR
will  not accept  just "*"  on a  DELETE or  ERASE command.)



Examples  of  wildcard  use  can  be  found  throughout this
manual.

2.B.2  Date/time and Length Criteria_____  _________ ___ ______ ________


FUR allows  file selection  by means  of the  SCAN switches.
Some of the more useful SCAN switches are:

     /BEFORE:date/time       Files created before date/time
     /SINCE:date/time        Files created since date/time
     /ABEFORE:date/time      Files accessed before date/time
     /ASINCE:date/time       Files accessed since date/time
     /LENGTH:n               Files > n blocks in length
     /LENGTH::n              Files < n blocks in length
     /LENGTH:m:n             Files between m and n blocks

Date/time can be specified in forms such as:

     23-Mar-76
     23-Mar-76:12:13:02
     Today:8:0:0
     Yesterday
     Monday:18:15:00

In addition, the  /DECIDE switch (see  page 12) can  be used
to indicate that you wish to further hand-pick certain files
which otherwise meet the given criteria.

Here are some more complete examples:
     All TMP files created today
             *.TMP/SINCE:TODAY
     All *.REL files over 100 blocks in length
             *.REL/LENGTH:100
     Hand-picked *.REL files over 100 blocks in length
             *.REL/LENGTH:100/DECIDE
     Files between 20 and 40 blocks in length that have not
     been used (accessed) in the last 30 days
             *.*/LENGTH:20:40/ABEFORE:-30D
     All TMP files not used today
             *.TMP/ABEFORE:TODAY

2.B.3  Additional Switch Selectives_____  __________ ______ __________


Files may be additionally selected based on the spooled file
name (/SPLNAM), the author or PPN (/AUTHOR), or  file status
(/STATUS).



The  selector  /SPLNAM:name   will  screen  files   for  the
attribute SPLNAM equal to the specified "name".

The selector /AUTHOR:[p,pn] will screen for files which were
marked as  written by  the given  [p,pn].  Wildcards  can be
used in  [p,pn].  The designator  [-] refers to  the current
default path; [,] is the PPN of the job running FUR.

The selector  /STATUS:nnn will screen  for files  which have
the octal value "nnn" as the value of the status  word.  Two
other variations are accepted: /STATUS:+nnn will  screen for
files with  any of  the bits  "nnn" turned  on; /STATUS:-nnn
will screen for files with all bits "nnn" turned off.

These switches can also  be used to change the  spooled file
name (see page  16), author word  (see page 17),  and status
bits (see page 17).

Examples:

     Find all system files which were written by me
             /FIND SYS:*.*/AUTHOR:[,]
     Delete all files with SPLNAM of "OLDVER"
             /DELETE *.*/SPLNAM:OLDVER

2.B.4  Connectives_____  ___________


When a list of filenames are allowed in a command,  they may
be separated by commas,  plus signs, or the  special symbols
'AND', 'OR', and  'NOT'.  The apostrophe characters  form an
integral part of the name.

When  the comma  is used,  the command  is  repeated several
times for each of the file specifications listed.

When  a plus  sign or  'OR' is  used, any  file  which meets
either the file specifications  to the left or to  the right                                            __
of the plus  sign or 'OR' is  used.  Although the  effect is
the same  as comma,  FUR has the  freedom to  re-arrange the
order of files when a plus sign or 'OR' is used.

If file specifications are  separated by 'AND', a  file must
match both the  left-hand side specification and  the right-                                             ___
hand side specification to be eligible for the command.

If two  file specifications are  separated by 'NOT',  a file



must  match the  left-hand  side specification  but  not the                                                     ___
right-hand specification.  The 'NOT' operation cannot be the
first thing in  a file specification;  it must come  after a
file  specification.   For  example,  /FIND  'NOT'  *.REL is
illegal, but /FIND *.* 'NOT' *.REL is OK.

The 'NOT'  operation cannot be  used with  certain switches.
These include: SPLNAM, AUTHOR, and STATUS.

Delete *.REL and *.CRF files in that order
        /DELETE *.REL,*.CRF
Delete *.REL and *.CRF files in any order
        /DELETE *.REL+*.CRF
Delete *.TMP files but not XYZ.TMP
        /DELETE *.TMP 'NOT' XYZ.TMP

2.B.5  File Defaults_____  ____ ________


When constructing a  complete file specification  based upon
defaults  and  upon  incomplete  constructions,  FUR follows
certain rules.

For the FIND command the defaults are to add an extension of
.* if none is given, and to search both SYS: and NEW: if the
current search list contains the NEW switch.

For the COPY, RENAME, and DELETE commands the default  is to
assume no extension.  If  SYS: is given as the  device, STD:
is substituted for it  (if available) in order to  avoid the
search of NEW: that would otherwise take place if NEW  is in
the search list.

Therefore, a  FIND SYS:FUR  might find  NEW:FUR.EXE[1,5] and
also SYS:FUR.EXE[1,4].   A DELETE  SYS:FUR.EXE will  fail if
there is not a file STD:FUR.EXE[1,4].

     Find all files beginning with letters FUR
             /FIND FUR*
     Delete all files beginning with letters FUR
             /DELETE FUR*.*



2.C  Setting Switches___  _______ ________


Switches are used to control file operations.   Switches are
initialized from the user file  DSK:SWITCH.INI[,].  Switches
not set in  SWITCH.INI can be  entered at the  slash prompt,
and  those  in  SWITCH.INI can  be  overriden.   See Section
2.E on page 20 for more information on SWITCH.INI.

2.C.1  DECIDE_____  ______


The DECIDE switch will turn on a prompting mode so  that the
user can decide whether to apply the operation on a file-by-
file  basis.   The  opposite  of  this  switch  is  NODECIDE
(default).  When  the DECIDE  option is  in force,  FUR will
print out the proposed operation and follow it by a question
mark.  The proper responses are: H (Help), Y (Yes),  N (No),
Q (Quit--abort  operation entirely; forget  the rest  of the
files), and G (Go--do  the rest of the files  without asking
me.  The G response also turns off the DECIDE mode  for that
set of  files.  No  carriage return  is necessary  after the
DECIDE response.

     Selectively delete *.EXE files
             /DELETE *.EXE/DECIDE
             DSKC:ABC.EXE[,] 5 ? Y
             DSKD:XYZ.EXE[,] 10 ? N
             [5 Blocks Deleted]
             /

In the above example,  the user chose to delete  ABC.EXE but
not XYZ.EXE.   When ABC.EXE  was deleted,  FUR noted  that 5
disk blocks had been deleted; this was the same as the total
number of disk blocks deleted which FUR printed at the end.

The DECIDE switch can be  set for all files by  including it
in the  SWITCH.INI file or  specifying DECIDE on  a separate
command line.  See page 20.

     Use DECIDE on *.TMP but not *.Z?? or *.Q??
             /DELETE *.Z??,*.TMP/DECIDE,*.Q??
     Same thing, another way
             /DECIDE
             /DELETE *.Z??/NODECIDE,*.TMP,*.Q??/NODECIDE



2.C.2  BEQUIET_____  _______


The  BEQUIET  switch  is used  to  suppress  typeout showing
progress of the file operations.  Summary information, error
printout,  and information  needed  for a  DECIDE  are still
printed.  The  opposite of  BEQUIET is  NOBEQUIET (default).
FUR runs faster in  BEQUIET mode because it need  not format
and print routine messages.

     Delete *.TMP without printing file names
             /DELETE *.TMP/BEQUIET
     Copy all of structure USRA: to structure BAKA:
             /BEQUIET
             /COPY BAKA:[*,*,*,*,*,*,*]=USRA:[*,*,*,*,*,*,*]

2.C.3  CONCATENATE_____  ___________


The CONCATENATE  switch is  used to  indicate that  during a
COPY  operation,  the  input files  are  to  be concatenated
together to form a single output file.  Concatenation refers
to the process  of making one  large output file  by copying
successive input files to  the end of the same  output file.
If the output  file name has  wildcards, they are  filled in
from the first input file  to be used.  Commas must  be used
to  delimit  input  file  names if  the  order  of  files is
important.   Separating input  file names  with a  plus sign
will cause the files to be concatenated together in an order
convenient for  FUR but  they must all  be contained  in one
directory.   See Section  2.B.4 on  page 10  for  details on
using the plus sign.

The normal mode  is NOCONCATENATE (default).  In  this mode,
each input file  is written to  a separate output  file.  If
the output file specification has no wildcards and there are
several  input files,  each copy  operation  supsersedes the
file created by the last  input file and the result  will be
that only the last input file was effectively copied.  Since
this is usually not  the desired result when one  (not wild)
output specification is  used with several input  files, FUR
will ask  the user  if /CONCATENATE  should be  used.  Under
BATCH, a warning will be printed and /CONCATENATE assumed.

When CONCATENATION  is in effect,  some of the  speedier FUR
shortcuts cannot be used and file copying may be slower than
usual.



     Copy all system fact files together except FACT.OLD.
             /CONCATENATE
             /COPY MYFACT.FIL=SYS:FACT.* 'NOT' FACT.OLD

The file attributes for the output file are copied  from the
first input  file encountered.  Use  /NEWFILE if you  do not
want  any  attributes  copied  (see  Section  2.C.6  on page
15).

2.C.4  ERSUPERSEDE_____  ___________


The /ERSUPERSEDE switch is  very useful on the  COPY command
to avoid overwriting  existing files.  When  the ERSUPERSEDE
switch is given, either on  an individual file name or  on a
global   basis,  the   COPY  command   is   prohibited  from
overwriting an existing  file of the same  name (superseding
it).  This technique therefore provides an added  measure of
protection  for  existing  files;  they  must  be explicitly
deleted before they can be replaced with a new file.

To have ERSUPERSEDE  in effect at  all times, include  it in
your  SWITCH.INI  file  (se page  20).   To  protect certain
files,  follow  the  file  specification  with   the  switch
/ERSUPERSEDE.  ERSUPERSEDE can be abbreviated to /ERSUP.  If
there  is  otherwise  no  file  specification  to  hang  the
/ERSUPERSEDE onto,  you can use  a file specification  of *.
See the example below.

     Copy all files with extension .F10 from [427,1362]
     without overwriting any existing files
             /COPY */ERSUPERSEDE=*.F10[427,1362]
     Or, do the same thing but in two steps
             /ERSUP
             /COPY =*.F10[427,1362]

To turn off the effect of /ERSUPERSEDE, use /OKSUPERSEDE.

2.C.5  OVERRIDE_____  ________


When  using the  DELETE  command, FUR  will ask  you  if you
really wish  to delete  a file  which is  normally protected
against deletion.  Other options are, however, available:




/OVERRIDE:NO                  Don't try to  delete protected
                              files.   Just  give  an  error
                              message.

/OVERRIDE:ASK                 (Default)  Ask  about deleting
                              protected files.

/OVERRIDE:YES                 (Dangerous)  Delete  protected
                              files without asking.

The /OVERRIDE:NO switch is  the default for batch  jobs.  If
you  place /OVERRIDE:NO  in your  SWITCH.INI file,  FUR will
never ask you to override the protection code  that prevents
accidental deletion.  This switch may be appropriate to help
protect files  that could be  accidentally deleted  by other
persons using your  account.  The /OVERRIDE:YES  switch will
automatically  attempt  to  delete  the  file  regardless of
protection code  and is probably  only appropriate  when you
wish to delete ALL files in a given UFD or SFD.

2.C.6  NEWFILE_____  _______


When copying files FUR normally copies the attributes of the
input  file  into   the  attributes  of  the   output  file.
Therefore,  the  copied  file will  have  the  original file
protection code, creation date, access date, version number,
spooled file  name, and so  on.  When privileged  users copy
files  with FUR,  the  copied attributes  also  include file
quotas, the account string, author field, etc.   (This means
that such parameters will be preserved if a  privileged user
copies entire file structures pack-to-pack.) On concatenated
copies, the attributes are taken from the first file copied.

Should you wish the new  file to be unencumbered by  the old
file  attributes,  you  can  use  the  NEWFILE  switch.  The
creation date will be set to today, the protection code will
be  the  default  (unless you  explicitly  specify  one with
/PROTECTION), the version number and spooled file  name will
be blank, and so on.



     Copy A.B to C.B giving C.B default protection code
     and current dates
             /COPY C/NEWFILE=A.B
     Change the creation date of A.FOR to today
             /COPY /NEWFILE=A.FOR
     Concatenate *.SYS files from ADM: together
     and give the output file system default attributes
             /NEWFILE
             /COPY ALLSYS./CONCATENATE=ADM:*.SYS

The  output  file in  a  RENAME command  can  also  take the
NEWFILE switch.  Due to the way the monitor works, this will
not change the  file's protection or  dates.  But it  can be
used to clear the version number and spooled file name.

2.C.7  SPLNAM_____  ______


One of  the file attributes  is its so-called  "spooled file
name".   The usefulness  of this  name existed  primarily as
file identification on MPB spooled files which are no longer
used at NIH.  This field  can therefore be used to  hold any
six-character  identification  that you  choose.   Like many
file attributes,  FUR will preserve  it when  you manipulate
the file with FUR but other system utilities (like  the text
editor) may wipe it out.

SPLNAM  can be  used as  both an  input file  switch  and an
output  file  switch.    If  you  specify  it   globally  in
SWITCH.INI or type it on a line by itself it applies to both
input and output files.

On output  files, SPLNAM:xyzabc sets  the spooled  file name
attribute to XYZABC.

On input files, SPLNAM:xyzabc selects only those files which
have the spooled file name XYZABC.

If you use  just SPLNAM: then FUR  will set a  blank spooled
file name on output and select only files with blank spooled
file names on input.

If you omit the colon and say just SPLNAM then FUR does what
it would do  had the switch  not been specified:  on output,
copy  any input  spooled  file name,  and on  input,  do not
select files based on the spooled file name.



     Set spooled file name (SPLNAM) to "SAIL"
             /RENAME /SPLNAM:SAIL=SYS:2OPS2.OPS
     Copy file 2OPS2.OPS to SYS: giving it the SAIL SPLNAM.
             /COPY SYS:/SPLNAM:SAIL=PAKN:2OPS2.OPS[16,13]
     Change the spooled file name to "SAIL!"
             /RENAME /SPLNAM:"SAIL!"=SYS:2OPS2.OPS
     Erase the spooled file name
             /RENAME /SPLNAM:=SYS:2OPS2.OPS
     Copy the file to your own area, retaining SPLNAM
             /COPY =SYS:2OPS2.OPS
     Move all files with SPLNAM SAIL from SYS: to OLD:
             /RENAME OLD:=SYS:*.*/SPLNAM:SAIL
     Delete all files with SPLNAM of TEMP
             /DELETE *.*/SPLNAM:TEMP
     Make a copy of all files marked MASTER in SPLNAM
             /COPY *.BAK=*.*/SPLNAM:MASTER

2.C.8  AUTHOR_____  ______


The /AUTHOR  switch takes  a [p,pn]  argument.  On  an input
specification, the  /AUTHOR switch is  used to  screen files
for those  written by  the given  [p,pn].  Wildcards  can be
used and [-] means the PPN of the current default path.

On an output specification, the author field of the  file is
changed to  the value  given and  wildcards cannot  be used.
This operation is only permitted to privileged users.

     Change author field of SPSS.EXE to [5,16]
             /RENAME /AUTHOR:[5,16]=SPSS.EXE
     Change files with author field [72,*] to [13,23]
             /RENAME /AUTHOR:[13,23]=*.*/AUTHOR:[72,*]

2.C.9  STATUS_____  ______


Files  can be  selected based  on the  RIB "status"  bits by
using the  /STATUS switch.  The  switch can also  change the
bit settings if the user is privileged.

The /STATUS:nnn  switch will select  files with  status bits
exactly equal to "nnn" octal on input and will change status
bits to "nnn" octal on output.

If a "+" precedes the  octal value, the file is  selected if
any of the  bits in the octal  word are also present  in the



file status.  If a "-" precedes the octal value, the file is
selected  if all  of  the bits  in  the octal  word  are not
present in the file status.  On output, a "+" turns  bits on
and a "-" turns bits off.

     Find all files marked as having a checksum error
             /FIND *.*/STATUS:+400
     Rename files having a bad checksum so they may be read
             /RENAME /STATUS:+20000=*.*/STATUS:+400

2.C.10  MAXCORE______  _______


The MAXCORE switch enables users to control core  usage when
FUR is copying or  erasing disk files.  Ordinarily  FUR will
attempt to allocate buffer space  in such a way as to  be as
efficient as possible.  In doing this with very  large files
FUR will grow tremendously, sometimes using the maximum core
size allowed.  At sites other than NIH where total user core
is not much larger than the maximum job size FUR  can appear
to  'take  over' the  system  when it  allocates  these huge
buffers.

The  MAXCORE switch  allows a  user to  specify  the maximum
amount of core that will be made available to FUR.  It takes
as  an  argument a  core  size in  either  words,  pages, or
thousands  of  words  ("K")  (Suffixes  "W",  "P",  and  "K"
respectivly).   Normally  words  are  used  as  the default;
however, if the value given  is less than 256 and  there was
no suffix given FUR will assume that the user meant "K".

             e.g.
             /MAXCORE:30     will limit FUR to a maximum
                             of 30K,

             whereas

             /MAXCORE:30P    will limit FUR to a maximum
                             of 30 Pages (or 15K).



2.D  Encryption___  __________


Data may be encrypted during a COPY command.  The encryption
algorithm is the same one that is used by SOS.  The Catholic
University TYPE program  which is used  at NIH for  the TYPE
command also has compatible decryption.

Encrypting a file changes it to gibberish so that even  if a
copy  should  fall  into  the  wrong  hands,  the   file  is
unreadable.  Before the file can be used again  (except with
SOS), it must be decrypted using the same key.

A key is a sequence  of characters that is used  to scramble
the data in  the encrypted file.   If the key  is forgotten,
the original data  is not recoverable.  Encrypted  files can
be  moved  and  copied like  other  files.   They  cannot be
compiled or printed  because they have been  scrambled.  You
should be careful  not to re-encrypt  a file which  has been
encrypted  once  already  since  the  data  will  be  doubly
scrambled and have to be decrypted twice using the same keys
in the reverse order.

Remember your  key!  If it  is lost, so  is your  data.  The
extension ENC is suggested for encrypted files so  that they
will not accidentally be printed or encrypted over again.

The /ENCRYPT switch  should be placed immediately  after the
file to which  the key applies.  A  file without any  key is
read/written without  encryption.  The /ENCRYPT  switch must
be followed by the key.   If the key consists of 6  or fewer
alphabetic  characaters,  no enclosing  quotation  marks are
required.  If  the key is  longer or if  special characters,
numbers, or punctuaction  is to be  included in the  key, it
must be surrounded by quotation marks.

The  switch /CRYPT  may  be used  in place  of  /ENCRYPT for
compatibility with the TYPE program.

When  using  file encryption,  multiple  file specifications
separated by  'AND', 'OR', +,  or 'NOT' are  not recommended
because FUR can't handle this combination properly.



     Make an encrypted copy of the file SOS.MAC:
             /COPY SOS.FUN/PROT:077/ENC:"SECRET KEY"=SOS.MAC
     Make this file usable again:
             /COPY SOS.MAC=SOS.FUN/ENCRYPT:"SECRET KEY"
     Change the key on the file to "WWW"
             /COPY SOS.MAC/ENC:WWW=SOS.MAC/ENC:"SECRET KEY"


2.E  SWITCH.INI and the OPTION Command___  __________ ___ ___ ______ _______


The SWITCH.INI file can  be used to set defaults  which will
apply  to all  appropriate FUR  commands.  In  addition, the
OPTION command  can be used  to set a  new group  of options
taken from SWITCH.INI.

For  example,  assume  that DECIDE  mode  should  be  set by
default.  SWITCH.INI would contain:

             FUR/DECIDE

In addition, SWITCH.INI can contain "named" sets  of options
which are used when the command "OPTION name" is given  as a
FUR command.

     SWITCH.INI might contain:
             FUR:CAREFUL/DECIDE/ERSUPERSEDE

     Then, if the FUR command
             /OPTION CAREFUL
     were given, DECIDE and ERSUPERSEDE modes would be
     turned on.  This is equivalent to turning on these
     switches directly as FUR commands:
             /DECIDE
             /ERSUPERSEDE
     but may be more convenient.



                         Section 3

                 Installation Instructions                 ____________ ____________




FUR is easily installed.   There is no NIH-specific  code in
FUR.  FUR searches  the universal files MACTEN,  UUOSYM, and
SCNMAC  which should  be on  device UNV:  (or DSK:).   It is
loaded with a special version of SCAN (SCN7BF), and standard
versions of WILD, HELPER, and ENDECR.

A version  of ENDECR that  has a RELOC  400000 added  at the
beginning will  make FUR load  much faster since  there will
then be no low  segment that must be initialized  from disk.
To see  if a low  segment will be  loaded, do an  examine of
location 133.   A value  of 137  or less  means that  no low
segment must be initialized.  If location 133 holds  a value
greater than 137, check to see if ENDECR has been  placed in
the high segment as desired.

In order to allow  plenty of room for lowseg  expansion, FUR
places  its high  segment  above 600000  in  user addressing
space.   This  technique  will  not  work  on  KA-10 systems
because of  the fixed  relocate-protect registers.   On such
systems, FUR should be recompiled.  The assembly  code tests
the kind of machine on  which it is assembling and  uses the
traditional 400000 high segment start if a KA-10 is in use.

The code is present in FUR to allow it to be run directly by
monitor commands for COPY, RENAME, and DELETE.  Note that it
will not be directly compatible with the present versions of
these commands.  For  COPY, options such as  P, W, A,  N, E,
etc. which are available in PIP are available with FUR.  For
RENAME, DECtapes  are not  supported.  For  DELETE, DECtapes
and TMPCOR files are not supported.



                         Section 4

                         Known Bugs                         _____ ____




There  are no  known bugs  in FUR.   However,  the following
complaints have been noted.


4.A  ?Illegal mode for device TTY___  ________ ____ ___ ______ ___


People will  try to use  FUR to type  out files.   This will
fail because  device TTY  cannot be  opened in  binary mode.
FUR is a disk utility only.  Much additional work would have
to be expended to make it useful on other devices.


4.B  Incorrect PPN___  _________ ___


When trying to  RENAME across file structure,  Incorrect PPN
message often results.   The monitor does not  allow renames
across file structures.


4.C  SCAN bugs___  ____ ____


In general, FUR suffers from all bugs in SCAN and WILD.  One
particular bug that was quite annoying was getting  "No Such
Directory" on a file you knew existed.  This  particular bug
was finessed by providing  FUR with a special  routine which
simulates WILD when no  actual wildcards are present  in the
file specification.   This also makes  FUR much  faster when
the file  name is completely  specified since WILD  does not
have to be initialized.  By bypassing WILD with a completely
specified  filename,  the   "No  Such  Directory"   bug  was
bypassed.

If you do find a  bug that might be SCAN-related, try  it on
DIRECT, BACKUP, DUMP or  some other category A  product that
uses SCAN and SPR it directly to Digital.



4.D  No Such Directory___  __ ____ _________


Depending on what version of WILD you have loaded  FUR with,
FUR  may fail  to  find files  on ersatz  devices  when your
default  path  is  an  SFD.   The  error  message  will  say
something like "No such directory [1,4,FOO]" if you  ask for
SYS:.   This is  a  wild bug.   Circumvention:  Find another
version of  WILD (try  WLD7A) to load  with your  version of
FUR.

                        Suggestions                        ___________




If  the time  were  available, the  following  are desirable
changes to the programs:

Work on non-disk devices.  (This would make it easier to use
to transplant the normal DELETE and RENAME commands.)

Implement a DECSUPEREDE in addition to ERSUPERSEDE.

Make FUR work with DECtapes. (Not much chance.)

Make  DELETE  command delete  all  subordinate  files before
trying to delete the SFDs.

                         Appendix B

                   Recent Program Changes                   ______ _______ _______





B.1  Changes from Version 2B to 2F___  _______ ____ _______ __ __ __


Here, in the  form of a news  release, are the  changes from
version 2B to 2F.

The FUR  file utility program  has been enhanced  to improve
its speed and make it easier and less expensive to run.

B.1.1  Speed-Ups_____  _________


The  FUR  COPY command  has  been  sped up  by  an  order of
magnitude through  the use of  unbuffered I/O.  The  time it
takes to copy files is  much less than for any  other system
program or  utility.  The difference  is most  pronounced on
large files where a  10:1 speedup is not  uncommon.  Besides
saving  time,  the  cost  of  performing  the  copy  is  cut
dramatically as well because fewer instructions  and monitor
operations are required.

Single  file operations  (where  the complete  file  name is
specified) are  now more  efficient because  the generalized
file  finding routine  is not  invoked.  Instead,  a special
one-file routine is used.

A  study  of  FUR showed  that  an  unwarranted  fraction of
computer  time was  being  spent in  the  type-out routines.
These  were made  more  efficient by  using  buffered input-
output.

B.1.2  Erase Command_____  _____ _______


A new  command, ERASE,  has been  added.  The  ERASE command
will erase a  magnetic tape by  using a special  function of
the tape drive.  On disk, ERASE will write the file to zeros
before deleting  it.  Both functions  are intended  to allow
confident  destruction  of  sensitive  data,  such  as  that
covered by the Privacy Act.



When erasing a magnetic tape,  be sure the write ring  is in
place; if the write ring is not in place, the  ERASE command
will take almost no  time at all (instead of  30-90 seconds)
and the tape  will not be erased.   You ask the  operator to
insert the write ring by using /WENABLE on a mount request.

Example:

     /ERASE MTB3:
     [MTB3 erased]

B.1.3  Version_____  _______


You can put  a version number on  a disk file by  copying or
renaming it using the /VERSION switch.

Examples:

     Put version number 23B on file PROD.SAI
             /RENAME /VERSION:23B=PROD.SAI
     Copy file FOO.FIL adding version number 17C(452)
             /COPY /VERSION:17C(452)=FOO.FIL[123,456]

Version numbers  can be placed  on source files,  REL files,
EXE files, data files, or anything else.  The version number
information is  lost if you  copy or change  it with  PIP or
SOS.

B.1.4  DECIDE And BEQUIET_____  ______ ___ _______


The DECIDE  and BEQUIET switches  can now apply  to specific
files.   The  method  previously  used  (putting  them  on a
separate line) will still work.

Example:

     /DELETE ABC.REL,*.TMP/DECIDE
        (Delete ABC.REL and ask about *.TMP)

B.1.5  Messages_____  ________


FUR  has  new  informational messages.   The  file  size (in
blocks) is almost always printed with the file name  to help
you  identify the  file.  Other  informational  messages are
printed in square brackets to advise you of FUR's actions.



B.1.6  Deleting Protected Files_____  ________ _________ _____


Files protected so that you cannot accidentally  delete them
can now be deleted by FUR if you insist (providing  they are
your files).  FUR will ask if you really want to  delete the
protected file if you try  to delete it.  If you  say Y(es),
FUR  will  go  ahead.   This  action  is  controlled  by the
/OVERRIDE switch.

/OVERRIDE:NO                  Don't try to  delete protected
                              files.   Just  give  an  error
                              message as in the past.

/OVERRIDE:ASK                 (Default)  Ask  about deleting
                              protected files.

/OVERRIDE:YES                 (Dangerous)  Delete  protected
                              files without asking.

B.1.7  Monitor Commands_____  _______ ________


Version 2F of FUR has been changed so that it can be invoked
from monitor commands.  It has not, however, been  tested in
this  way.   FUR  is  insufficient  in  implementing  DELETE
because it does not  handle TMPCOR or DECtapes.   In RENAME,
DECtape support is missing.  For COPY, switches  that modify
the file, such as PIP switches  E, N, T, W, P, etc.  are not
available in FUR because  FUR never modifies a  file (except
to encrypt and decrypt it).

B.1.8  No Such Directory_____  __ ____ _________


A major  bug plaguing  FUR users  was the  SCAN/WILD (mostly
WILD) bug where  it would claim  "% No Such  Directory" when
you asked for an operation on someone else's  perfectly good
file.   This problem  has been  finessed by  writing  a WILD
substitute that  can handle  the case  of a  fully specified
filespec.  It was precisely  this case that was  tripping up
WILD  on  systems   with  multiple  file   structures.   The
substitute  routine is  also  much faster  and  quicker, and
avoids initializing all  of WILD when  the user has  given a
complete filespec.



B.1.9  Minor Bug Fixes_____  _____ ___ _____


Copying CRASH.EXE  from SYS:  is no  longer a  problem.  (In
older versions,  FUR faithfully copied  the "do  not delete"
bit  as  well as  the  data.) FUR  no  longer  loses version
numbers of files on RENAMEs or COPYs.  Operations  on device
NUL: work better.  Protection codes are always  printed with
3  digits.  FUR  doesn't print  out NEW:XYZ.EXE[1,4]  when a
LOOKUP  on  NEW:  is performed  and  the  monitor  returns a
specific   file   found   on   SYS:;   instead   it   prints
SYS:XYZ.EXE[1,4].


B.2  Changes from Version 2F to 2I___  _______ ____ _______ __ __ __


Here are the changes present from version 2F to 2I

B.2.1  NEWFILE Switch_____  _______ ______


The NEWFILE switch was  added to FUR.  This  switch bypasses
the routines that preserve RIB information from the input to
output files  and can  be used to  create files  with virgin
attributes.  For more information see Section 2.C.6  on page
15.

B.2.2  SPLNAM Switch_____  ______ ______


The 2I  version of  FUR allows files  to be  given so-called
spooled file names.  These names were previously only in use
in the  MPB batch  system and FUR  makes them  available for
general use.  The  general idea was that  common identifiers
could be put in  the spooled file name to  permit operations
on groups of files that had the same spooled file name.  For
example,  all of  the files  belonging to  a  given software
system could be given a common spooled file name  that would
permit them to be operated upon as a unit with FUR.

B.2.3  Core Usage_____  ____ _____


Several bugs were present that prevented FUR  from returning
all of the core that it used.  These have all been fixed.  A
problem that led to ?Address check for device RPA3  has been
solved; it was also a core usage problem.



B.2.4  Concatenation Messages_____  _____________ ________


The  messages that  are  printed now  clearly  indicate when
concatenation  is taking  place.  It  is  therefore visually
clear  whether  concatenation  (appending)  is  happening or
whether the  output file  is being  continually overwritten.
(The latter  is a common  problem encountered by  people who
type /COPY A.B=C,D,E.)

B.2.5  Extra RIB Values Processed_____  _____ ___ ______ _________


FUR  has  been updated  to  understand and  process  the new
values present in  6.03 RIBs including  directory expiration
date,  last  accounting  date,  account  string,   etc.   In
addition,  a  bug was  fixed  that often  zero'd  the .RBTIM
value.   RENAME and  COPY are  now much  more  consistent in
their use of the various exotic RIB parameters.


B.3  Changes from Version 2I to 2L___  _______ ____ _______ __ __ __


Here are the changes present from version 2I to 2L

B.3.1  Prompt Made for CONCATENATE_____  ______ ____ ___ ___________


The FUR  default of NOCONCATENATE  was not intuitive  if the
input  command is  something  like "COPY  A=B,C".   The user
assumed that B and C  would be concatenated to form  A while
the FUR rules say that B would be first copied to A,  then C
copied to A  (overwriting the copy  of B) as  would normally
happen under NOCONCATENATE.

Now FUR will prompt in  such a circumstance to ask  the user
if CONCATENATE should be used.  The prompt can be stifled by
using  either CONCATENATE  or NOCONCATENATE  to  begin with.
Running under batch, no prompt will be made  and CONCATENATE
will be used.

B.3.2  Pad command_____  ___ _______


The  PAD  command  was  added  to  FUR.   This  command adds
additional  empty  blocks  at  the end  of  a  file.   It is



primarily used  to protect  ISAM index  and data  files from
system crashes.  For  more information see Section  2.A.5 on
page 6.

B.3.3  MAXCORE switch_____  _______ ______


The MAXCORE switch  was added to  FUR. This switch  allows a
user to specify a maximum  core size for FUR.  When  used it
forces  FUR  to never  use  more core  than  that  which was
specified  when it  is building  it's internal  I/O buffers.
This will  prevent FUR  from growing  to fill  all available
core when  copying or  erasing very  large files.   For more
information see Section 2.C.10 on page 18.

B.3.4  File Already Exists Message_____  ____ _______ ______ _______


The  error  message  "File  Already  Exists"  usually  means
/ERSUPERSEDE  was  set  (either  by  SWITCH.INI  default  or
expicitly).   The error  message has  been extended  to give
this hint to the user.


B.4  Changes from Version 2L to 2M___  _______ ____ _______ __ __ __


Here are the changes made after version 2L.

B.4.1  ERASE Command Gives Error on Write-Lock_____  _____ _______ _____ _____ __ __________


The ERASE  command has  been modified  to generate  an error
message  if the  magnetic tape  in question  is write-locked
(has  no  write  ring).   Previously  no  error  message was
generated, in the erroneous belief that the monitor  call to
erase the tape would take the error return if the  tape were
write-locked.

B.4.2  Number of Blocks Re-Defined_____  ______ __ ______ __________


FUR's  statistics for  the number  of blocks  transferred is
being calculated  in a new  way.  Previously, the  number of
blocks copied by a transfer command was computed  by keeping
track  of  words  transferred and  rounding  to  blocks just
before printing.  Now the rounding will take place  on every



transfer  so  that the  figure  will agree  with  the higher
figures  given  by  DIRECT.   The  transfer  rate  is  still
computed according to the number of words transferred.

B.4.3  Single Star Disallowed as File Spec for DELETE and_____  ______ ____ __________ __ ____ ____ ___ ______ ___
         ERASE         _____


One user reported trying to type "DELETE *.TMP" and actually
entering "DELETE  *,TMP" with  disastrous results.   FUR now
requires the specification "*.*" to be used explicitly  on a
DELETE or ERASE command if you wish to specify all files.  A
null   filespec  or   a  single   star  will   be  rejected.
Exceptions: If /DECIDE was specified on the filename  (or as
a global  switch) then  "*.*" need not  be used  because you
will have a chance to recover the possible error.   Also, in
a batch job, "*" and  null filespecs will work as  before to
preserve compatibility.


B.5  Changes from Version 2M to 2O___  _______ ____ _______ __ __ __


B.5.1  AUTHOR and STATUS Switches Added_____  ______ ___ ______ ________ _____


The /AUTHOR  and /STATUS switches  added by Dave  Baldwin at
Catholic  University  were  incorporated  for  the  COPY and
RENAME operations.

B.5.2  MAIL area files names printed as [p,pn]_____  ____ ____ _____ _____ _______ __ ______


If assembled for Catholic University or NIH, MAIL will print
out the names of files used by the NIH mail system as [p,pn]
instead of crazy sixbit values.

B.5.3  ISAMDUMP Command_____  ________ _______


The ISAMDUMP Command Was  Added by Dave Baldwin  of Catholic
University.
