   40Useful commands:                                                          
   40                                                                          
   40   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions      
   40for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses   
   40printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'          
   40command restores long descriptions.                                       
   40   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea       
   40of what the game is about.                                                
   40   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish         
   40to continue playing.                                                      
   40   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation. 
   40   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.                           
   40   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.          
   40   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.          
   40   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.             
   40   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.           
   40   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.               
   40                                                                          
   40Command abbreviations:                                                    
   40                                                                          
   40   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.                        
   40   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.                             
   40   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.                             
   40                                                                          
   40Containment:                                                              
   40                                                                          
   40   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can      
   40be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may        
   40not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object             
   40which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you             
   40to see such an object, the container must be either open or               
   40transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;         
   40the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their           
   40sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be         
   40in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program         
   40will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which            
   40process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers        
   40can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than        
   40one level down.                                                           
   40                                                                          
   40Fighting:                                                                 
   40                                                                          
   40   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when              
   40attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.             
   40Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',           
   40etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a                
   40fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,              
   40getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.                
   40Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to           
   40fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details              
   40should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.                      
   40                                                                          
   40Command parser:                                                           
   40                                                                          
   40   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.         
   40For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their           
   40first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing          
   40'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also           
   40creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-           
   40tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.        
   40                                                                          
   40   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands         
   40the following types of things--                                           
   40                                                                          
   40   Actions:                                                               
   40	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.           
   40	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,              
   40	PUT DOWN, etc.                                                           
   40                                                                          
   40   Directions:                                                            
   40	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.            
   40	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in           
   40	only certain situations.                                                 
   40                                                                          
   40   Objects:                                                               
   40	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.                   
   40                                                                          
   40   Adjectives:                                                            
   40	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are               
   40	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,          
   40	DOORs, BUTTONs).                                                         
   40                                                                          
   40   Prepositions:                                                          
   40	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but           
   40	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous               
   40	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON        
   40	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.          
   40	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR         
   40	WITH DEMON' won't parse.                                                 
   40                                                                          
   40   Sentences:                                                             
   40	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-        
   40	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)           
   40	can be placed on the same line.                                          
   40                                                                          
   40   Ambiguity:                                                             
   40	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of            
   40	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.         
   40	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume             
   40	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.                 
   40	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.                      
   50Welcome to Dungeon!                                                       
   50                                                                          
   50   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast         
   50quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.      
   50In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To     
   50receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy      
   50case in the living room of the house.                                     
   50                                                                          
   50   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects         
   50which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may      
   50need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,        
   50since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading     
   50material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it             
   50is rumored to be useful.                                                  
   50                                                                          
   50   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.            
   50When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a             
   50certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding      
   50the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure       
   50safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In          
   50addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated     
   50with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,     
   50which you may do only twice.                                              
   50                                                                          
   50   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who           
   50likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the      
   50light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure    
   50rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which   
   50you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste     
   50he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines 
   50his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-       
   50ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders   
   50through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).                    
   60Please answer the question.                                               
   70You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the      
   70dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be     
   70installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers   
   70may gloat over them.                                                      
   80What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running       
   80TOPS-20 system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.        
   90Now let me see...                                                         
   90Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have        
   90everything.                                                               
  100Do you wish me to try to patch you?                                       
  110You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house               
  110there is a window which is #.                                             
  120open                                                                      
  130slightly ajar                                                             
  140You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have         
  140been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to       
  140the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the        
  140east is a small window which is #.                                        
  150You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west    
  150is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be       
  150nailed shut.                                                              
  160You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west    
  160is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some       
  160strange gothic lettering.                                                 
  170In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.                        
  180In the center of the room is a closed trap door.                          
  190In the center of the room is an open trap door.                           
  200There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.                           
  210You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading        
  210east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a        
  210steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.                                    
  220The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.                   
  230You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty                  
  230passages in the immediate vicinity.                                       
  240Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.           
  250Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.                    
  260Above you is a grating.                                                   
  270You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west          
  270and south.                                                                
  280There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.                     
  290There is an open grating descending into darkness.                        
  300A grating appears on the ground.                                          
  310You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.           
  320You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a              
  320reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely        
  320a wide stream running through the center of the room.                     
  330There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway          
  330climbing up along the edge of a cliff.                                    
  340You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.           
  340Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow             
  340cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.                      
  350You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a          
  350large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.               
  360You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.            
  370You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly     
  370a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely      
  370a wide stream running through the center of the room.                     
  380There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.                          
  390You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls         
  390and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.                   
  400Part of the glacier has been melted.                                      
  410There is a large passageway leading westward.                             
  420You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits       
  420on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is     
  420an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.                           
  430Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless            
  430actions.                                                                  
  440		BOOOOOOOOOM                                                             
  450You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one          
  450corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes     
  450dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an          
  450obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the    
  450label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-     
  450ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4        
  450inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.           
  460closed                                                                    
  470The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.    
  480You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.              
  490In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who       
  490is obviously deranged and holding his nose.                               
  500A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down                 
  500from the ceiling and lifts you away...                                    
  510You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling         
  510of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a       
  510wooden railing which circles the dome.                                    
  520Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet         
  520from the floor below.                                                     
  530I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.                   
  540You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down        
  540staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a      
  540large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up        
  540around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the     
  540center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.                      
  550A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some        
  550five feet above your head.                                                
  560You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.         
  570Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.       
  580According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic         
  580fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.     
  580I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.          
  590You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:                   
  590                                                                          
  590	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."                             
  590                                                                          
  590The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of    
  590mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some       
  590hideous fate, can be heard.                                               
  600The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your      
  600attempts to pass.                                                         
  610There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the                
  610cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you             
  610are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.         
  620You are not equipped for an exorcism.                                     
  630There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the                
  630cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense             
  630of a greater power, flee through the walls.                               
  640You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate            
  640room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the            
  640sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In                
  640the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous             
  640adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east           
  640is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.                    
  650Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,               
  650tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.                             
  660You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was            
  660quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths         
  660to the north, south, east, and down.                                      
  670The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can        
  670be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from         
  670the lake.                                                                 
  680It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind     
  680the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-       
  680stream through the gates.                                                 
  690There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the        
  690panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.                   
  700The green bubble is glowing.                                              
  710The water level is now up to your ankles.                                 
  720The water level is now up to your shins.                                  
  730The water level is now up to your knees.                                  
  740The water level is now up to your hips.                                   
  750The water level is now up to your waist.                                  
  760The water level is now up to your chest.                                  
  770The water level is now up to your neck.                                   
  780The water level is now over your head.                                    
  790The water level is now high in your lungs.                                
  800The room is full of water and cannot be entered.                          
  810I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.                                
  820You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.        
  820Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.                  
  830The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room            
  830suddenly vanish.                                                          
  840Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.                         
  850Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very            
  850smart thing to do, apparently.                                            
  860You seem to be digging a hole here.                                       
  870The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.                          
  880You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.                        
  890You can see a small statue in the sand.                                   
  900The wall collapses, smothering you.                                       
  910There is nothing to dig into here.                                        
  920You are digging into a pile of bat guano.                                 
  930You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.                                
  940You are covered with bat turds, cretin.                                   
  950This is getting you nowhere.                                              
  960You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a         
  960drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.          
  960There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.                
  970A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.           
  980A solid rainbow spans the falls.                                          
  990According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic         
  990fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards      
  990of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming     
  990out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.                               
 1000You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the            
 1000volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop          
 1000below to the floor.                                                       
 1010The way to the south is blocked by rubble.                                
 1020There is a small door to the south.                                       
 1030The way to the south is blocked by rubble.                                
 1040You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except        
 1040for an exit on the north size.                                            
 1050Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that             
 1050the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been                
 1050chipped out of the front of it.                                           
 1060On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.            
 1070You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.          
 1070There are exits to the east and southeast.                                
 1080As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.                        
 1090The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.                          
 1100The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.                          
 1110The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.    
 1120The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.                   
 1130The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large      
 1130chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the         
 1130ground.  Fatally.                                                         
 1140The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.                           
 1150You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of      
 1150that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the         
 1150dungeon has collapsed.                                                    
 1160The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,                  
 1160turning you into a pancake.                                               
 1170The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,        
 1170turning you into a pancake.                                               
 1180A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,          
 1180"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on      
 1180trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."        
 1180You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.             
 1190Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears       
 1190seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible       
 1190voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You    
 1190have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them       
 1190all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"         
 1190He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a         
 1190wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.

 1210Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.               
 1220The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust      
 1220at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.                      
 1230The lid opens.                                                            
 1240The lid closes.                                                           
 1250Look around.                                                              
 1260You think it isn't?                                                       
 1270I think you've already done that.                                         
-1280The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any     
-1280attempt by robbers to remove it).                                         
-1270The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.                            
-1260The basket is at the other end of the chain.                              
-1250A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.                                 
-1240The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.               
-1230The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.                 
-1220It is not tied to anything.                                               
-1210There is nothing it can be tied to.                                       
-1200The rope is already attached.                                             
-1190The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.      
-1180I see no objects here.                                                    
-1170Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.                  
-1160The rope drops gently to the floor below.                                 
-1150The rope is tied to the railing.                                          
-1140The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.          
-1130The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you               
-1130notice an irregularity beneath it.                                        
-1120The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.                         
-1110With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.            
-1110With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.        
-1100Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible                
-1100to move it again.                                                         
-1090You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.                              
-1080Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.                   
-1070The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an                  
-1070an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.          
-1060Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties         
-1060than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.               
-1050There is an explosion nearby.                                             
-1040The wire rapidly burns into nothing.                                      
-1030The match has gone out.                                                   
-1020The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.                                    
-1010The lamp is dying.                                                        
-1000The candles grow short.                                                   
 -990The candles are very short.                                               
 -980The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.                     
 -970The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends         
 -970the neighbors that they come over and put you out.                        
 -960As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse           
 -960of blinding blue light.                                                   
 -950As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an          
 -950overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade       
 -950is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it          
 -950savagely cuts your throat.                                                
 -940A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration           
 -940of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on               
 -940all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of             
 -940the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.                
 -930There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.        
 -920There is an ugly person staring at you.                                   
 -910The mirror is broken into many pieces.                                    
 -900Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.        
 -890You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of      
 -890good luck available.                                                      
 -880Haven't you done enough already?                                          
 -870The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,       
 -870devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes         
 -870downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,         
 -870there is a passageway leading west.                                       
 -860The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving         
 -860you in the dark.                                                          
 -850The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.                        
 -840Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.         
 -830burned out ivory torch                                                    
 -820There is a burned out ivory torch here.                                   
 -810The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.                             
 -800The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.                         
 -790The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.                          
 -780You seem unable to affect these spirits.                                  
 -770How can you attack a spirit with material objects?                        
 -760The book is open to page 569.                                             
 -750As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.                            
 -740A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you           
 -740have turned into a pile of dust.                                          
 -730I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.                              
 -720One of the matches starts to burn.                                        
 -710The match is out.                                                         
 -700The tube refuses to accept anything.                                      
 -690The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.                  
 -680The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.              
 -680The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."             
 -670The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use     
 -670a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the       
 -670gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.         
 -660The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you       
 -660put in that drink, anyway?).                                              
 -650The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses           
 -650your generous gesture.                                                    
 -640The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.                          
 -630The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!                              
 -620The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.                                      
 -610The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.                          
 -600The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.              
 -590The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering     
 -590condiments for his upcoming snack.                                        
 -580The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.                 
 -570You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.                        
 -560Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but       
 -560they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.                
 -550The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.                
 -540The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.     
 -530You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.                
 -520Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you           
 -520tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.                        
 -510Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the          
 -510artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.                            
 -500worthless piece of canvas                                                 
 -490There is a worthless piece of canvas here.                                
 -480With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.       
 -470The window closes (more easily than it opened).                           
 -460The bolt won't turn with your best effort.                                
 -450The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.                   
 -440The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.       
 -430You can't do that!                                                        
 -420The grating is locked.                                                    
 -410The grating opens to reveal trees above you.                              
 -400The grating opens.                                                        
 -390The grating is unlocked.                                                  
 -380The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending       
 -380into darkness.                                                            
 -370The door swings shut and closes.                                          
 -360The door is locked from above.                                            
 -350The door cannot be opened.                                                
 -340You cannot burn this door.                                                
 -330The door is invulnerable.                                                 
 -320You cannot damage this door.                                              
 -310The door is still under warranty.                                         
 -300The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display          
 -300of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the           
 -300excitement fades.                                                         
 -290The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.                          
 -280A force keeps you from taking the bodies.                                 
 -270The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,     
 -270"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole. 
 -260The lights within the room shut off.                                      
 -250The lights within the room come on.                                       
 -240Click.                                                                    
 -230There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst         
 -230from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred           
 -230in a pipe).                                                               
 -220The blue button appears to be jammed.                                     
 -210The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.                            
 -200The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.                                  
 -190You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.                           
 -180This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.            
 -170Well done.  The boat is repaired.                                         
 -160There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.                           
 -150The boat deflates.                                                        
 -140You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.                            
 -130The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.                            
 -120Very good.                                                                
 -110The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.                
 -100Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,             
 -100walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).             
  -90The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined            
  -90precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported           
  -90by water vapor.                                                           
  -80The ballon is fastened to the hook.                                       
  -70The balloon is not tied to anything.                                      
  -60The wire falls off the hook.                                              
  -50The box is imbedded in the wall.                                          
  -40What do you expect, BOOM?                                                 
  -30The box has no door!                                                      
  -20The box is rusted and will not open.                                      
  -10The box is not open, chomper!                                             
    1The wire starts to burn.                                                  
   11"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a             
   11# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end              
   11of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney             
   11sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears             
   11from sight.                                                               
   21"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching                
   21the # in his rock hard hands.                                             
   31The gnome appears increasingly nervous.                                   
   41Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin         
   41would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to           
   41prevent this.                                                             
   51Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for      
   51your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and       
   51of your life.                                                             
   61Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately   
   61for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.   
   71As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling          
   71to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming        
   71into the room.                                                            
   81As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the              
   81ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.      
   81Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and          
   81crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.                  
   91There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.                     
  101Nothing seems to happen.                                                  
  111The whirring increases in intensity slightly.                             
  121The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.                             
  131A dull thump is heard in the distance.                                    
  141The flask breaks into pieces.                                             
  151Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.                                   
  161Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the             
  161flask's contents are fatal.                                               
  171Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.                     
  181The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to        
  181be clearly visible.                                                       
  191You can't see through that!                                               
  201The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.                
  211The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".                                   
  221The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".                                 
  231The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".                                   
  241The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.             
  251The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble          
  251from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing         
  251with blasting cakes.                                                      
  261You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).                 
  271The room around you seems to be getting smaller.                          
  281The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems            
  281that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is             
  281more or less demolished.                                                  
  291The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the      
  291floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.         
  301How romantic!                                                             
  311If you must... Poof, you're dead!                                         
  321The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the        
  321earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable              
  321appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been         
  321seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws         
  321to tell the tale.                                                         
  331There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in      
  331the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!       
  341The bucket rises and comes to a stop.                                     
  351The bucket descends and comes to a stop.                                  
  361You notice that the # has burned out, and that                            
  361the cloth bag is starting to deflate.                                     
  371I hope you have more light than from a #.                                 
  381I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a            
  381# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,                        
  381there is still justice in the world.                                      
  391Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal       
  391gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.              
  401There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.                             
  411The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.                  
  421You won't melt it with a #.                                               
  431The bolt can't be turned with your #.                                     
  441It seems that a # won't do.                                               
  451With a #?                                                                 
  461The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike                        
  461appendage in thanks.                                                      
  471A #?  Surely you jest.                                                    
  481He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the        
  481kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.                    
  491You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.                     
  501I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.                         
  511At your service!                                                          
  521The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.      
  531Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!                                    
  541It could very well be too late.                                           
  551The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).                    
  561Naturally!                                                                
  571AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!                                             
  581Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.                           
  591Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?                           
  601Are you enjoying yourself?                                                
  611Wheeeeee!                                                                 
  621Do you expect me to applaud?                                              
  631Such language in a high-class establishment like this!                    
  641You ought to be ashamed of yourself.                                      
  651It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.                     
  661Tough shit, asshole.                                                      
  671Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!            
  681That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.                            
  691I think you are taking this thing for granite.                            
  701Brief descriptions.                                                       
  711Maximum verbosity.                                                        
  721No long descriptions.                                                     
  731You can see:  A #.                                                        
  741Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.                                  
  751I don't really see how.                                                   
  761I think that swimming is best performed in water.                         
  771Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.                                 
  781Wasn't he an Indian?                                                      
  791I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a             
  791barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number      
  791of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.          
  801Wasn't he a sailor?                                                       
  811The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room       
  811by knocking down the wall on the north size of the room.                  
  821There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.                       
  831Well what?                                                                
  841If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.                         
  851Nothing happens.                                                          
  861I don't really know how to do that.                                       
  871Do you wish to leave the game?                                            
  881Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.                               
  891Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.                                 
  901Hello.                                                                    
  911Good day.                                                                 
  921Nice weather we've been having lately.                                    
  931Goodbye.                                                                  
  941Here, nothing happens.                                                    
  951Nothing happens here.                                                     
  961I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.                            
  971You seem to be repeating yourself.                                        
  981The # bows his head to you in greeting.                                   
  991I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.                        
 1001It is impossible to read in the dark.                                     
 1011How does one look through a #?                                            
 1021How can I read a #?                                                       
 1031How, exactly, do I ring that?                                             
 1041Ding, dong.                                                               
 1051I'm not sure that a # can be melted.                                      
 1061If you wish, but I can't understand why.                                  
 1071Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what               
 1071you want to brush them with.                                              
 1081A nice idea, but with a #?                                                
 1091Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of         
 1091glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,        
 1091and you die of respiratory failure.                                       
 1101Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.                                  
 1111Inflating it further would probably burst it.                             
 1121How can you inflate that?                                                 
 1131Come on, now!                                                             
 1141The # isn't sleeping.                                                     
 1151This has no effect.                                                       
 1161does not seem to do anything useful                                       
 1171is not notably useful

 1221Kicking a # #.                                                            
 1231Waving a # #.                                                             
 1241Playing in this way with a # #.                                           
 1251Fiddling with a # #.                                                      
 1261Pushing the # #.                                                          
 1271I don't think so.                                                         
-1279This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!                              
-1269How can you tie that to anything?                                         
-1259You can't tie the # to that.                                              
-1249You could certainly never tie the # with that!                            
-1239The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.                                
-1229Why would you tie up a #?                                                 
-1219You can't turn that.                                                      
-1209You certainly can't turn it with a #.                                     
-1199Digging with the # is slow and tedious.                                   
-1189Digging with a # is silly.                                                
-1179I don't think that anybody is home.                                       
-1169Why knock on a #?                                                         
-1159It sounds like there is something inside the #.                           
-1149The contents of the # spill out.                                          
-1139I can't get to that to move it.                                           
-1129You can't move the #.                                                     
-1119You can't turn that on.                                                   
-1109It is already on.                                                         
-1099You can't turn that off.                                                  
-1089It is already off.                                                        
-1079The # is now on.                                                          
-1069The # is now off.                                                         
-1059It is now pitch black.                                                    
-1049You must tell me how to do that to a #.                                   
-1039The # cannot be opened.                                                   
-1029Opened.                                                                   
-1019Opening the # reveals:                                                    
-1009The # cannot be closed.                                                   
 -999It is already open.                                                       
 -989It is already closed.                                                     
 -979Closed.                                                                   
 -969There is a # here.                                                        
 -959You are carrying a #.                                                     
 -949It is in the #, which is in the room.                                     
 -939It is in the #, which you are carrying.                                   
 -929Time passes...                                                            
 -919The # must be on the ground to be boarded.                                
 -909I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.                              
 -899You are already in the #, cretin!                                         
 -889You are now in the #.                                                     
 -879You aren't in that!                                                       
 -869You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably          
 -869be fatal.                                                                 
 -859You are on your own feet again.                                           
 -849You can't go there without a vehicle.                                     
 -839You can't go there in a #.                                                
 -829I see nothing special about the #.                                        
 -819It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.                  
 -809You are in the #.                                                         
 -799The # has died.                                                           
 -789The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in           
 -789the guttural tongue of the trolls.                                        
 -779The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his                 
 -779bloody axe.                                                               
 -769An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out          
 -769of the room are open.                                                     
 -759A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages      
 -759out of the room.                                                          
 -749The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.                      
 -739The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".             
 -729The troll laughs at your puny gesture.                                    
 -719The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #                   
 -709The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift           
 -699and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.         
 -689and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the         
 -689troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does        
 -689not look pleased.                                                         
 -679Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.                                           
 -669You can't take the #.                                                     
 -659Aren't you forgetting something?                                          
 -649That would be a good trick.                                               
 -639The # is too big to jump over.                                            
 -629You should have looked before you leaped.                                 
 -619I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.                  
 -609In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.          
 -599Geronimo...                                                               
 -589I don't think that the # would agree with you.                            
 -579I think you should get that first.                                        
 -569Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.                             
 -559How can I drink that?                                                     
 -549I'd like to, but I can't get to that.                                     
 -539Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all             
 -539this talking.                                                             
 -529The # catches fire.                                                       
 -519Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.                           
 -509You don't have that.                                                      
 -499The # catches fire and is consumed.                                       
 -489I don't think you can burn a #.                                           
 -479It doesn't seem to work.                                                  
 -469Can you unlock a grating with a #?                                        
 -459Munging a # #.

 -439Trying to attack a # #.                                                   
 -429There is nothing here to attack.                                          
 -419I've known strange people, but attacking a #?                             
 -409with your bare hands is suicidal                                          
 -399with that is very self-destructive                                        
 -389You are in perfect health.                                                
 -379You have a light wound.

 -329You can be killed by one more light wound.                                
 -319You can be killed by a serious wound.                                     
 -309You can survive one serious wound.                                        
 -299You are strong enough to take several wounds.                             
 -289You have been killed once.

 -169Your sword is no longer glowing.                                          
 -159Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.                             
 -149You sword has begun to glow very brightly.                                
 -139Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous                 
 -139neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.                       
 -129The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly             
 -129recovers his stilletto.                                                   
 -119His booty remains.                                                        
 -109As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his              
 -109treasures reappear:  A #.                                                 
  -99  A #.                                                                    
  -89There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning          
  -89against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.          
  -79There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the         
  -79ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.                     
  -69The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and       
  -69when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.                         
  -59Once you got him, what would you do with him?                             
  -49You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although       
  -49it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does        
  -49seem angered by your attempt.                                             
  -39You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.  
  -29You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,  
  -29but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.                            
  -19Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.                     
   -9The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as      
   -9stupid as you are?                                                        
    2The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.                
   12The candles are not lit.                                                  
   22The flame is extinguished.                                                
   32Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to      
   32burn.                                                                     
   42With what?                                                                
   52The candles are lit.                                                      
   62The candles are already lit.                                              
   72You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.           
   82You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.                
   92The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.     
  102Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.           
  112Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.        
  122You can't go that way.                                                    
  132The # is closed.                                                          
  142I can't reach that.                                                       
  152You aren't carrying that.                                                 
  162Dropped.                                                                  
  172Thrown.                                                                   
  182You watch as the balloon slowly lands.                                    
  192The balloon has landed.                                                   
  202You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.                         
  212You watch as the balloon slowly descends.                                 
  222The balloon descends.                                                     
  232You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.     
  242Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and        
  242causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?         
  252You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.                                  
  262The balloon ascends.                                                      
  272You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,   
  272due to its light load.                                                    
  282The balloon leaves the ledge.                                             
  292You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.                                
  302The balloon slowly rises from the ground.                                 
  312The cloth bag is draped over the side.                                    
  322The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning                         
  322in the receptacle.                                                        
  332The balloon is tied to the hook.                                          
  342I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.                     
  352You are tied to the ledge.                                                
  362You don't really want to hold a burning #.                                
  372The receptacle is already occupied.                                       
  382The # burns inside the receptacle.                                        
  392The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.                            
  402Not likely.                                                               
  412An interesting idea, but...                                               
  422A valiant attempt.                                                        
  432You can't be serious.                                                     
  442Not a prayer.                                                             
  452You already have it.                                                      
  462Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.         
  472Taken.                                                                    
  482Nice try.                                                                 
  492I can't do that.                                                          
  502I can't reach inside.                                                     
  512How can you do that?                                                      
  522The # is already in the #.                                                
  532It won't fit.                                                             
  542I can't reach the #.                                                      
  552The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.                            
  562"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."      
  572"My vision is not that good without eyes."                                
  582"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."               
  592ECHO                                                                      
  592The acoustics of the room change subtly.                                  
  602Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of                     
  602sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the            
  602carcass has disappeared.                                                  
  612The # contains:                                                           
  622Your collection of treasures consists of:                                 
  632You are carrying:                                                         
  642The # is carrying:                                                        
  652By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to                  
  652stop the leak in the dam.                                                 
  662You are empty handed.                                                     
  672It is too dark in here to see.                                            
  682#:                                                                        
  692I could't find anything.                                                  
  702I couldn't find any valuables.                                            
  712Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the       
  712walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that      
  712the bag will be taken only over his dead body.                            
  722Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of            
  722valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful       
  722nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.         
  732The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.                 
  732Fortunately, he took nothing.                                             
  742A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding             
  742nothing of value, he left disgruntled.                                    
  752A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through         
  752the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the       
  752room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto         
  752others before...".                                                        
  762The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,       
  762left disgusted.                                                           
  772The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not         
  772have noticed that he robbed you blind first.                              
  782Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this      
  782fine # is doing here?"                                                    
  792You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is            
  792ineffective.                                                              
  802Attacking a dead # is pointless.                                          
  812Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?                  
  822The # slowly regains his feet.                                            
  832The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.                        
  842It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid           
  842that you are dead.                                                        
  852Saved.                                                                    
  862I can't access the save file.                                             
  872Restored.                                                                 
  882Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.                        
  892I don't understand that.                                                  
  902You cannot talk to that!                                                  
  912You cannot talk through another person.                                   
  922Please input the entire command again.                                    
  932Fortunately, you still have a #.                                          
  942You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase          
  942leading up.                                                               
  952A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere               
  952adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health             
  952and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very           
  952friendly, though he likes people.                                         
  962The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't       
  962think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for        
  962a cyclops.                                                                
  972The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.         
  972His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.                   
  982The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping        
  982blissfully at the foot of the stairs.                                     
  992On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which      
  992now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.                                      
 1002The bottle is closed.                                                     
 1012The bottle is already full.                                               
 1022The bottle is now full of water.                                          
 1032The water slips through your fingers.                                     
 1042Too many prepositions.                                                    
 1052Too many objects.                                                         
 1062I can't see one here.                                                     
 1072Which one do you mean?                                                    
 1082I can't reach that from inside the #.                                     
 1092What should I do with the #?                                              
 1102Huh?                                                                      
 1112You must supply a direct object.                                          
 1122You must supply an indirect object.                                       
 1132Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my        
 1132abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.           
 1132Please let me express my profoundest regrets.                             
 1142The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge      
 1142your greeting with his usual graciousness.                                
 1152The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts        
 1152the # and stops to admire its beauty.                                     
 1162The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.                         
 1172The # is empty.                                                           
 1182I don't know how to look inside a #.                                      
 1192There is nothing interesting there.                                       
 1202I don't really see how.                                                   
 1212The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.               
 1222You can't wind a #.                                                       
 1232You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.                     
 1242A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence      
 1242in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty      
 1242surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message        
 1242brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."                       
 1252An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a     
 1252safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have          
 1252forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the     
 1252box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes      
 1252here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks         
 1252askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.                             
 1262The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;         
 1262you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,       
 1262leaving you alone in the bare room.                                       
 1272Talk about eating rich foods!                                             
-1278Nothing like having money to burn!                                        
-1268"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with     
-1268disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an        
-1268understated "pop".                                                        
-1258The gnome carefully places the # in the                                   
-1258deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear     
-1258that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
-1258disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.     
-1248The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his        
-1248fingers, leaving you alone.                                               
-1238The gnome appears increasingly impatient.                                 
-1228There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.             
-1218The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.        
-1208The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.      
-1208From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a       
-1208limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,      
-1208a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top        
-1208of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds     
-1208down, the song bird flies away.                                           
-1198The cliff is too steep for climbing.                                      
-1188The egg is already open.                                                  
-1178There is no obvious way to open the egg.                                  
-1168I doubt you could do that without damaging it.                            
-1158The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has               
-1158seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.                                 
-1148The concept of using a # is certainly original.                           
-1138Not to say that using a # isn't original either...                        
-1128You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.      
-1128The egg is now open.                                                      
-1118Climbing the walls is of no avail.                                        
-1108Bizarre!                                                                  
-1098The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.                     
-1088The # falls to the ground.                                                
-1078You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large          
-1078branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.             
-1068On the ground below you can see:                                          
-1058I can't see any wall here.                                                
-1048That cannot be turned.                                                    
-1038You would be lost without me.                                             
-1028You don't have the #.                                                     
-1018The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.                     
-1008I can't see any song bird here.                                           
 -998You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...                      
 -988You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.                 
 -978You can't go more than part way through the curtain.                      
 -968That would involve quite a contortion!                                    
 -958You are in it, turkey!                                                    
 -948As you try, your hand seems to go through it.                             
 -938The # goes through it.                                                    
 -928The # passes through the wall and vanishes.                               
 -918The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.                        
 -908I can't do that with everything at once.                                  
 -898There is a wall there.                                                    
 -888There is no way up.                                                       
 -878There is no way down.                                                     
 -868You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are         
 -868dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.     
 -868In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around     
 -868which is engraved a compass rose.                                         
 -858Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from       
 -858pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent       
 -858Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are         
 -858portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped     
 -858around formidable bludgeons.                                              
 -848Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from       
 -848pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent       
 -848Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are         
 -848portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped     
 -848around formidable bludgeons.                                              
 -838A passage enters from the south.                                          
 -828The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with              
 -828their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.               
 -818To the north and south are large hallways.                                
 -808To the north is a large hallway.                                          
 -798You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather        
 -798complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor        
 -798is open.                                                                  
 -798   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of         
 -798carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel      
 -798is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left        
 -798half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white     
 -798opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the       
 -798black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of        
 -798the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.                         
 -798   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot       
 -798deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the        
 -798exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular               
 -798depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this       
 -798area is a compass rose.                                                   
 -798   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height         
 -798is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced       
 -798in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus      
 -798in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room    
 -798(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden     
 -798pole.                                                                     
 -798   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a        
 -788foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on      
 -788the stone floor.                                                          
 -778foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been           
 -778dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.                            
 -768foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted    
 -768out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough       
 -768friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.                        
 -758foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been           
 -758dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.                      
 -748foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned      
 -748above the stone channel in the floor.                                     
 -738   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling        
 -738through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The           
 -738bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long         
 -738attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and          
 -738T-bar are pointing #.

 -648You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north        
 -648and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north

 -638You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north        
 -638and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north      
 -638end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the      
 -638room by a # lying on the floor.                                           
 -628Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the          
 -628sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of        
 -628this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of     
 -628the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the        
 -628crypt to the south.  The door is #.                                       
 -618You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern         
 -618and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An              
 -618additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.             
 -608In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door           
 -608which is #.                                                               
 -598You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door     
 -598and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.            
 -588You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.       
 -578The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The       
 -578panel is #, and the door is #.                                            
 -568You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern       
 -568parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer          
 -568towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west       
 -568ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small     
 -568window barred with iron.  The door is #.                                  
 -558You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large         
 -558parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the      
 -558smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less      
 -558bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself        
 -558is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about        
 -558two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,     
 -558so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.                              
 -558   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are         
 -558an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face       
 -558of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points      
 -558to the number "#".

 -468You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames        
 -468and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door         
 -468in front of you.                                                          
 -458You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west          
 -458corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.                    
 -448Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.                          
 -438You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely        
 -438fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out        
 -438its small window.

 -428fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out        
 -428its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door         
 -428which seems to be #.                                                      
 -418   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon            
 -418master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have       
 -418solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume     
 -418your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I        
 -418waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you      
 -418lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.  
 -418You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a        
 -418moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the      
 -418treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist       
 -418and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.                              
 -408Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat             
 -408disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.          
 -408As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you       
 -408and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of            
 -408Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the            
 -408future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time           
 -408transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say          
 -408	INCANT, <word>                                                           
 -408and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying               
 -408	INCANT, <phrase>                                                         
 -408Good luck, and choose wisely!"                                            
 -398The button pops back to its original position.                            
 -388The mirror quietly swings shut.                                           
 -378The pine wall closes quietly.                                             
 -368The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.                           
 -358The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.                      
 -348The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.                       
 -338The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.                            
 -328The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.             
 -318The pine wall swings open.                                                
 -308The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.              
 -298The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't          
 -298budge.                                                                    
 -288The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.               
 -278The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.              
 -268The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.                
 -258The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his              
 -258suspicions are aroused.                                                   
 -248Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by        
 -248them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer         
 -248the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they      
 -248resume their posts.                                                       
 -238A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions     
 -238are aroused.                                                              
 -228Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.     
 -228Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and     
 -228they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.                                 
 -218The statues are impassive.                                                
 -208The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your      
 -208blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises      
 -208his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it             
 -208completes you crumble into dust.                                          
 -198"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"           
 -188The pole is now slightly above the floor.                                 
 -178The pole cannot be raised further.                                        
 -168The pole cannot be lowered further.                                       
 -158The pole is lowered into the channel.                                     
 -148The pole is lowered into the stone hole.                                  
 -138The pole is already resting on the floor.                                 
 -128The pole now rests on the stone floor.                                    
 -118The button becomes depressed.                                             
 -108The button pops back out.                                                 
  -98The button is already depressed.                                          
  -88No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.                          
  -78The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.                    
  -68You can't break the beam with a #.                                        
  -58The # already breaks the beam.                                            
  -48I see no bronze door here.                                                
  -38The bronze door opens.                                                    
  -28The bronze door closes.                                                   
  -18On the other size of the door is a narrow passage which opens out         
  -18into a larger area.                                                       
   -8The door won't budge.                                                     
    3The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there         
    3will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden     
    3panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an       
    3old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:            
    3   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure            
    3that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are            
    3admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether     
    3you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great                
    3Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for         
    3one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly           
    3discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.           
    3Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five           
    3attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and      
    3admit you to these regions.                                               
    3   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."                
   13The booming voice asks:                                                   
   23"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing      
   23through the cyclops room?"                                                
   33"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"   
   43"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid              
   43treasures, in Zorkmids?"                                                  
   53"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"    
   63"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"                          
   73"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"                          
   83"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"                                  
   93"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"                      
  103The door is securely fastened.                                            
  113The wooden door opens.                                                    
  123The wooden door closes.                                                   
  133The dungeon master says, "I will stay."                                   
  143The dungeon master says, "I will follow."                                 
  153There is no reply.                                                        
  163"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."                                 
  173"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."                            
  183"I cannot perform that action for you."                                   
  193This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.                                
  203This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.                                 
  213This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.                                
  223This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.                              
  233This gives you the rank of Cheater.                                       
  243You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice           
  243says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"                                 
  243In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It       
  243is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four      
  243headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the             
  243cryptic inscription:                                                      
  243                                                                          
  243		"Feel Free".                                                            
  253The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.            
  263The crypt is already open.                                                
  273The crypt is already closed.                                              
  283The crypt is closed.                                                      
  293The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".                       
  303There is no answer.                                                       
  313No one seems to be listening.                                             
  323The dungeon master says, "Excellent."                                     
  333The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."    
  343The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."   
  353The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."     
  363The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."      
  373The mirror is closed.                                                     
  383You must specify what to set the dial to.                                 
  393The dial face contains only numbers.                                      
  403The dial now points to "#".                                               
  413The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.                   
  423The cell door is now closed.                                              
  433You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.                       
  443The dungeon master catches up with you.                                   
  453The dungeon master follows you.                                           
  463There is a wooden wall blocking your way.                                 
  473There is a large mirror blocking your way.

  493The structure blocks your way.                                            
  503As you leave, the door swings shut.                                       
  513You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.               
  523You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.               
  533You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel

  563The panel has been opened outward.                                        
  573The opposite wall is solid rock.                                          
  583The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,            
  583obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head         
  583and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."      
  583With that, he departs.                                                    
  593The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a            
  593master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive          
  593wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.

  653I don't see any way to open the mirror here.                              
  663The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.                           
  673The mirror has already been broken.                                       
  683The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward       
  683as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather          
  683fragile.                                                                  
  693The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.                        
  703I can't see a panel here.                                                 
  713I don't see any way to open the panel here.                               
  723To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.              
  733The panel is not that easily destroyed.                                   
  743The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out           
  743when you let go.                                                          
  753The panel is unyielding.                                                  
  763A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.                               
  773The mirror is broken into little pieces.                                  
  783Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.                     
  793The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small             
  803hallways to the #east and #west.                                          
  813A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.                           
  823A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.                            
  833The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.                         
  843The corridor continues north.                                             
  853The corridor continues south.                                             
  863The corridor continues north and south.                                   
  873Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.                   
  883That incantation seems to have been a failure.                            
  893Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.                                
  903That spell has no obvious effect.                                         
  913As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness           
  913envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.                   
  923The structure won't budge.                                                
  933You are in a room with an exit to the north and a steel door to the east. 
  943You are in a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.    
  953The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the steel          
  953door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment           
  953later, a previously unseen sign flashes:                                  
  953	"Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"              
  963The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously            
  963unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,                    
  963now atomized, spews through the slot.                                     
  973I can't see any ladder here.                                              
  983Come, come!                                                               
  993You hit your head on the ceiling and fall off the ladder.                 
 1003You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with         
 1003marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.              
 1013It appears the thief was correct.                                         
 1023In the ceiling above you is a large circular opening.                     
 1033The center of the floor is noticeably depressed here.                     
 1043The west wall here has a large steel door at its center.  On one side     
 1043of the door is a small slit.                                              
 1053The west wall here has a large opening at its center.  On one side        
 1053of the opening in a small slit.                                           
 1063There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the east wall.                 
 1073There is a ladder here, firmly attached to the west wall.                 
 1083There is only a passage in that direction.                                
 1093The wall does not budge.                                                  
 1103The wall slides forward and you follow it...                              
 1103The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further       
 1103descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3          
 1103grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone    
 1103and marble.  The following notations will be used:                        
 1103			..  = current position (middle of grid)                                
 1103			MM  = marble wall                                                      
 1103			SS  = sandstone wall                                                   
 1103			??  = unknown (blocked by walls).                                      
 1113The wall slides forward and you follow it to the following position:      
 1123Your position is as follows:                                              
 1133The exit is too far above your head.                                      
 1143With the help of the ladder, you exit the puzzle.                         
 1153Don't be lazy, type the command yourself.                                 
 1163In the MDL sources, NOOBJ is described as a "hack".  As we are            
 1163above such practices, NOOBJ is not implemented.                           
 1173The grating closes.                                                       
   10Your swing misses the # by an inch.

  180Slash!  Your blow lands!  That one hit an artery, it could be serious!

  300The # is knocked out!                                                     
  310It's the end for the # as your knife severs his jugular.

  660Heedless of your weapons, the cyclops tosses you against the rock         
  660wall of the room.

  710The cyclops grabs your #, tastes it, and throws it to the

  920The troll sees a hole in your defense, and a lightning stroke opens a     
  920deep wound in your left side.                                             
  930The troll hits you with a glancing blow, and you are momentarily stunned. 
  940The troll swings.  The blade turns on your armor but crashes broadside    
  940into your head.

  960The troll's mighty blow drops you to your knees.                          
  970The axe hits your # and sends it spinning.                                
  980The troll swings.  You parry, but the force of his blow disarms you.      
  990The axe knocks your # out of your hand.  It falls to the floor.           
 1000You parry the blow, but your # is knocked from your hand.                 
 1010The troll strikes at your unconscious form but misses in his rage.        
 1020The troll hesitates, fingering his axe.                                   
 1030The troll scratches his head ruminatively.  Might you be magically        
 1030protected, he wonders?                                                    
 1040The troll seems afraid to approach your crumpled form.                    
 1050Conquering his fears, the troll puts you to death.                        
 1060The thief stabs nonchalantly with his stilletto and misses.               
 1070You dodge as the thief comes in low.                                      
 1080You parry a lightning thrust, and the thief salutes you with a            
 1080grim nod.                                                                 
 1090The thief tries to sneak past your guard, but you twist away.             
 1100Shifting in the midst of a thrust, the thief knocks you unconscious       
 1100with the haft of his stilletto.                                           
 1110The thief knocks you out.                                                 
 1120Finishing you off, a lightning throw right to the heart.                  
 1130The stilletto severs your jugular.  It looks like the end.                
 1140The thief comes in from the side, feints, and slips the blade             
 1140between your ribs.                                                        
 1150The thief bows formally, raises his stilletto, and with a wry grin        
 1150ends the battle and your life.                                            
 1160A quick thrust pinks your left arm, and blood starts to trickle           
 1160down.                                                                     
 1170Raking his stilletto across your arm, the thief draws blood.              
 1180The stilletto flashes faster than you can follow, and blood               
 1180wells from your leg.                                                      
 1190The thief slowly approaches, strikes like a snake, and leaves you         
 1190wounded.                                                                  
 1200The thief strikes like a snake!  The resulting wound is serious.          
 1210The thief stabs a deep cut in your upper arm.                             
 1220The stilletto touches your forehead, and the welling blood obscures       
 1220your vision.                                                              
 1230The thief strikes at your wrist, and suddenly your grip is slippery       
 1230with blood.                                                               
 1240The butt of his stilletto cracks you on the skull, and you stagger back.  
 1250You are forced back and trip over your own feet, falling heavily to       
 1250the floor.                                                                
 1260The thief rams the haft of his blade into your stomach, leaving you       
 1260out of breath.                                                            
 1270The thief attacks, and you fall back desperately.                         
-1280A long theatrical slash.  You parry it desperately, but the thief         
-1280twists his knife, and your # goes flying.                                 
-1270The thief neatly flips your # out of your hands, and it drops to the      
-1270floor.                                                                    
-1260You parry a low thrust, and your # slips out of your hand.                
-1250Avoiding the thief's stilletto, you stumble to the floor, dropping        
-1250your #.                                                                   
-1240The thief, a man of good breeding, refrains from attacking a helpless     
-1240opponent.                                                                 
-1230The thief amuses himself by searching your pockets.                       
-1220The thief entertains himself by rifling your pack.                        
-1210The thief, noticing you beginning to stir, reluctantly finishes you off.  
-1200The thief, forgetting his essentially genteel upbringing, cuts your       
-1200throat.                                                                   
-1190The thief, who is essentially a pragmatist, dispatches you as a threat    
-1190to his livelihood.                                                        
   10You are in a narrow east-west passageway.  There is a narrow staircase    
   10leading down at the north end of the room.                                
   20You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded         
   20front door.                                                               
   30You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here,   
   30and all the windows are barred.                                           
   40You are facing the south side of a white house.  There is no door here,   
   40and all the windows are barred.                                           
   70You are in the attic.  The only exit is stairs that lead down.            
  100You are in a small room with passages off in all directions.              
  100Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.    
  110You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.                   
  120You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

  300You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.                   
  310You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.             
  320You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the       
  320east, there appears to be sunlight.                                       
  330You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One          
  330particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.               
  340You are in a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except        
  340to the east, where a small clearing may be seen.                          
  350You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.             
  370You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.        
  370Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase     
  370descends.                                                                 
  380You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing       
  380is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages    
  380can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.     
  420You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path      
  420travels to the north and the east.                                        
  430You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow   
  430to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting        
  430walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.                               
  440You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an         
  440ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.          
  460You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.       
  460To the south and west are small passageways.                              
  470You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are      
  470exits to the southeast and upward.                                        
  480You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off            
  480to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of             
  480flowing water below.                                                      
  490You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from      
  490the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone      
  490stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it       
  490is difficult to hear yourself think.                                      
  520You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway      
  520leading down.                                                             
  530You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,         
  530forbidding staircase leading down.                                        
  540You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to    
  540the south and southwest.                                                  
  550You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,    
  550However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.            
  560You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway     
  560intersects with a northward path.                                         
  570You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit        
  570on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be         
  570heard faintly to the north.                                               
  580You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a          
  580coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE         
  580WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and         
  580there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance      
  580of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the      
  580north is a small opening.                                                 
  590You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal           
  590mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,      
  590and there is another exit on the south end of the room.                   
  600You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming       
  600from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.      
  610You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft          
  610descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and        
  610the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the      
  610shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.       
  620You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across         
  620the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into      
  620paths running west and northeast.                                         
  630You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction        
  630of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the      
  630east is a narrow path.                                                    
  640You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.                
  650You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden          
  650ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is         
  650also a staircase leading upward.                                          
  660You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.                            
  670You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.                            
  680You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.                            
  690You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.                            
  700You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.                            
  710You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.                            
  720You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.                            
  730You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a            
  730narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages        
  730leaving the room.                                                         
  740Dead end.                                                                 
  750You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken      
  750timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the            
  750southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.               
  760You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long           
  760shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow    
  760passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.                    
  810You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.      
  810There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.     
  820You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be        
  820seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow         
  820passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south. 
  840You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.      
  850A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The     
  850path exits to the south and to the east.                                  
  860You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but       
  860the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly       
  860damp here.                                                                
  870A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the         
  870cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.                          
  880Dead end.                                                                 
  890Dead end.                                                                 
  900You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.        
  910This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.        
  910To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the           
  910following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without       
  910solving this riddle--                                                     
  910	What is tall as a house,                                                 
  910	Round as a cup,                                                          
  910	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".                            
  920This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.       
  950You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of      
  950stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.                
  960You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an       
  960ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.      
  960The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the     
  960room is through huge marble pillars.                                      
  970You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what       
  970appears to be an altar.                                                   
  990This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring        
  990the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked               
  990"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.           
 1000You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood       
 1000control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the       
 1000room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of     
 1000the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a         
 1000panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of     
 1000different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this       
 1000room are in the west and south ends.                                      
 1020You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the         
 1020east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about           
 1020cyclops sized).                                                           
 1030This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number        
 1030of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about       
 1030on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly       
 1030created passage to the east.                                              
 1040You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls       
 1040and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.             
 1040Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and     
 1040northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An       
 1040extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although    
 1040you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you       
 1040could get back down.                                                      
 1050You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here         
 1050have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals          
 1050left through the north, south, or west exits.                             
 1060You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you        
 1060and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the      
 1060river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching    
 1060from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its     
 1060way downstream.                                                           
 1070You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river        
 1070flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.                
 1080The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the             
 1080dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks             
 1080prevent landing on the west.                                              
 1090The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on        
 1090the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which      
 1090may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.          
 1100You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the       
 1100white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south          
 1100along the cliffs.                                                         
 1110You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A           
 1110narrow path leads north along the shore.                                  
 1120The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be       
 1120that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small      
 1120area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.                          
 1130The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west        
 1130shore is a large landing area.                                            
 1150You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat         
 1150treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end      
 1150quickly turning around a sharp corner.                                    
 1160You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is        
 1160flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.      
 1170You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is         
 1170to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.                          
 1180You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.       
 1190You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the       
 1190barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".                                           
 1210You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk       
 1210on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow         
 1210travels east-west here.                                                   
 1220You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River          
 1220past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white     
 1220cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from         
 1220above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path   
 1220continues to the southeast.                                               
 1230You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable     
 1230here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the      
 1230runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.                  
 1240You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.         
 1240You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists        
 1240along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the        
 1240canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears              
 1240climbable.                                                                
 1250You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here       
 1250there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River     
 1250upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still         
 1250appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and       
 1250northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.             
 1250Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the      
 1250top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the             
 1250west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles        
 1250around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.          
 1260You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you         
 1260light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only        
 1260exit here is to the north.                                                
 1270You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The      
 1270top of the volcano is clearly visible here.                               
-1280You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming          
-1280above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the           
-1280west side.                                                                
-1270You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of        
-1270the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the         
-1270east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.          
-1260You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet     
-1260across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.         
-1250You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant        
-1250volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the        
-1250floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.       
-1240You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you           
-1240the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.       
-1240A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;          
-1240it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between           
-1240those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.         
-1220You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably          
-1220for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed      
-1220to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.                 
-1200You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.      
-1200There are exits here to the west and the south.                           
-1170You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room       
-1170smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring          
-1170sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons     
-1170which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,       
-1170above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign       
-1170above all the buttons says in English:                                    
-1170

-1170There are exits to the west and the south.                                
-1160You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall      
-1160is a small sticker which reads:

-1150You are trapped inside an steel cage.                                     
-1140You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on        
-1140the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the     
-1140entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.             
-1130You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and        
-1130mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be     
-1130some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.           
-1120You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large         
-1120oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the       
-1120objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern      
-1120corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.        
-1120There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.         
-1110You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden       
-1110posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to      
-1110be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be         
-1110abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large         
-1110chasm on the west and the northwest.                                      
-1100You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a      
-1100large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is             
-1100falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.                    
-1080You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest       
-1080banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial           
-1080account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with     
-1080the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit     
-1080less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography       
-1080"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".                                    
-1080Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All        
-1080that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of      
-1080the room, which say

 -980You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to       
 -980a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the          
 -980passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.                 
 -970You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the           
 -970south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illum-         
 -970inated by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall        
 -970is a red button.

 -690You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated           
 -690in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its              
 -690contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.         
 -690   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of         
 -690zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.         
 -690   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes          
 -690as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of           
 -690the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and              
 -690other informative and inspiring works.                                    
 -690   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of            
 -690Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,          
 -690and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.            
 -690   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock              
 -690certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo             
 -690International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company

 -680You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently      
 -680created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten      
 -680feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There       
 -680are exits to the west and south.

  340Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.                
  450Lying half buried in the mud is an old trunk, bulging with jewels.        
  460Lying in the corner of the room is a small brass bell.                    
  470On the alter is a large black book, open to page 569.

 1040On the floor is a gold zorkmid coin (a valuable collector's item).        
 1080The excessively gaudy crown of Lord Dimwit Flathead is here.              
 1210There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced      
 1210by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.            
 1220There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the       
 1220paper once contained useful information, almost nothing can be            
 1220distinguished now.

-1030On the branch is a small birds nest.                                      
-1020In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,         
-1020apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is       
-1020covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and           
-1020mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a          
-1020delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely      
-1020fragile.

 -980There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It seems to

 -680Nestled inside the niche is an engraved gold card.                        
  410The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by        
  410an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the       
  410ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs      
  410are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred        
  410texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems     
  410to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.  
  440The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly              
  440remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can       
  440be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects, absent-         
  440mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The        
  440final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the               
  440dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient             
  440Zorkers were obscure indeed.

  490  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the        
  490Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the          
  490Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million           
  490zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local       
  490tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure     
  490is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the        
  490center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind       
  490the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million      
  490square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.                        
  490                                                                          
  490  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to        
  490the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave         
  490drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear          
  490tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234             
  490bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),          
  49012,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape          
  490processors, and nearly one million dead trees.                            
  490

  500This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely         
  500reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created         
  500at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the          
  500parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version           
  500is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.

  510Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look           
  510forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising

  520   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets

  520   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT  
  520Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce        
  520Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of      
  520Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax            
  520and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).     
  520The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by            
  520a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.         
  520
