			350-point Adventure Maps
			------------------------

Following is a set of 10 maps giving the rooms and their conections for
the 350-point version of Adventure. I do not guarantee that these maps
are complete and correct; if you find mistakes, please email me at
	wkt@csadfa.cs.adfa.oz.au.

Description of Maps
-------------------

Each map has a set of rooms, and arrowed lines joining them. Each room has
a short room description, the program's internal room number, and a set of
arrows showing how to get to other rooms. Arrows either end pointing to
another room (in a box), the name of another room (unboxed), or the room
number.

The default arrow directions are n,s,e,w as shown below; arrows may have other
direction labels which are defined below:


	N		n	up		( These are the words
	^		s	down		  you can enter to move.)
	|		e	building
    W<-- -->E	 or 	w	grate
	|		nw	xyzzy
	V		ne	plugh
	S		sw 	canyon
			se 

? means that there is a connection between these rooms, but I do not
know what to type to pass through it.

Notes
-----

Some rooms are initially unconnected; you must perform an action to connect
them. The final connection is shown on the maps, with no indication as to
what action to perform.

The connectivity between the `Maze of Twisty Little Passages, All Different'
is given below as a table. I have not done a similar table for MOTLP,AA.


Quick Room Reference

Here is a by-number description of the rooms in Adventure, with the objects
therein. Some rooms not given form part of the MOTLP,AD & MOTLP,AA mazes, 
others hold descriptions like `you've broken you're neck', and are not
true rooms.
